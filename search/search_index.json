The nanowire is typically made of a superconducting material such as niobium nitride (NbN), niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN), or tungsten silicide (WSi). The nanowire is connected to a readout circuit which is used to detect the electrical signals generated by the SNSPD upon absorption of a single photon.</p> <p>When a photon hits the wire, it breaks a superconducting electron pair, or Cooper pair. This disruption creates quasiparticles and initiates a down-conversion cascade. This localized disruption of superconductivity in turn leads to the formation of region of reduced superconductivity called a hot-spot. The hot-spot has a higher resistance than the superconducting state, which due the initial flow of current, induces a voltage pulse from this region. This pulse is shunted out of the nanowire and into a readout circuit, which amplifies the pulse, and may include electronics for digitizing the pulse arrival time. Following the formation of the hotspot, the nanowire cools down through electron-phonon interaction with the substrate and returns back to the superconducting state, making it ready for the next photon detection.</p> <p>The readout scheme typically adopted for the detection of these electrical signals involves separating the RF and DC components of the RF line from the SNSPD using a bias-T circuit. The RF component is afterwards amplified using one or more cryogenic or room temperature amplifiers.

For example, one study has investigated using SNSPDs for direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter <sup>22</sup>, while others have proposed using SNSPDs as photosensors in cryogenic scintillator-based experiments <sup>23</sup>. Another notable approach involves the search for dark photon dark matter using multilayer dielectric haloscopes <sup>24</sup><sup>25</sup>. SNSPDs are employed to achieve efficient photon detection, improving the limits on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon dark matter, and providing valuable insights into the nature of dark matter in the eV mass range.</p> <p>Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement: SNSPDs were used for diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) measurements for the observation of cerebral blood flow <sup>26</sup>. The high sensitivity of SNSPDs improved the signal-to-noise ratio and enabled the detection of low-intensity signals associated with pulsatile flow. This advancement in DCS technology has the potential to improve the understanding and diagnosis of cerebral blood flow-related conditions.</p> <p>Deep Space Optical Communication: SNSPDs played a crucial role in the development of ground laser receiver (GLR) systems for deep space optical communication <sup>27</sup>. The GLR, equipped with an array of SNSPDs, received optical downlink signals from spaceborne transceivers. These detectors facilitated the processing of discrete downlink data rates over large distances, making significant contributions to the success of the Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) project.</p> <p>Photon Counting LIDAR: SNSPDs have also found application in LIDAR systems operating at 2.3\u00a0\\(\\upmu \\mathrm{m}\\) wavelength <sup>28</sup>, demonstrating enhanced photon counting performance in the mid-infrared region and making them suitable for free-space photon counting applications.

Amplifier jitter is the effect of readout electrical noise on timing jitter. In contrast, geometric jitter originates from propagation delays due to detection events happening at varying locations along the nanowire\u2019s twist. Nanowires made of thin-film materials exhibit high kinetic inductance and behave like transmission lines with high characteristic impedance and slow phase velocity. These transmission line properties result in pulse propagation delays that contribute to the timing jitter of the detector. The arrival time of voltage pulses from the detector to time tagging equipment depends on the location of photon absorption in the nanowire, as detections closer to the ground termination and farther from the single readout travel farther at low phase velocity through the nanowire before exiting. For large detectors, geometric jitter can contribute tens of picoseconds to the total system jitter. Increasing detector size for resolving a given optical mode usually improves detection efficiency. Thus, using single-ended readout leads to a tradeoff between system detection efficiency and jitter induced by longitudinal geometric effects.</p> <p>Adopting a differential readout approach can resolve the aforementioned issues. Instead of just isolating the positive voltage pulse, the negative pulse from the other end of the nanowire is also collected. Simple processing of both pulses reveals information about photon arrival time as well as photon arrival location.</p> <p>If the measurements of arrival time \\(t_F\\) and absorption location along the nanowire are both significant to the application, then the timing of the \\(t_{neg}\\) negative and positive \\(t_{pos}\\) voltage pulses may be read out with two time taggers or high-speed oscilloscope channels. The difference of arrival time \\(t_{pos} - t_{neg}\\) of these signals constitutes the photon absorption location information, while the average \\((t_{pos} + t_{neg})/2\\) of the arrival times constitutes the photon arrival time information. For practical single photon counting applications, however, the photon arrival time information is typically sufficient and real-time processing of two time tags per detection event is not practical. Therefore, a 2:1 balun transformer can be used to perform an equivalent hardware difference of the positive and negative pulses (analogous to the averaging of timetags \\(t_{pos}, t_{neg}\\)). After amplification, the two sides of the detector are connected to the differential inputs of the balun, with the output being sent to a TCSPC or equivalent time tagging module. The threshold voltage of the time tagger can be set to minimize the spread of time tag distribution, corresponding to the condition where the timing measurement \\(t_{tagger} \\approx t_F\\), negating the photon arrival location information.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_01/section_04_dtsnspd/#impedance-matching-tapers","title":"Impedance matching tapers","text":"<p>In a typical SNSPD, the nanowire exhibits an impedance on the order of \\(\\mathrm{k} \\Upomega\\), while the readout circuit has an impedance of 50\u00a0\\(\\Upomega\\). This mismatch can lead to RF pulses that exhibit reflections and distortions. These effects reduce slew rate and lower Signal to Noise Ratio, resulting in higher amplifier jitter\u00a0<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>The higher jitter that results from the impedance mismatch can be mitigated by designing the SNSPD to preserve the integrity of the output pulse. An impedance-matching taper interfacing the nanowire to the readout line can be integrated. Thanks to the gradual impedance transformation of a Klopfenstein-style taper, the output pulse has a higher amplitude and a faster slew rate. In a simplified theoretical SNSPD model by Colangelo et al.\u00a0<sup>1</sup>, the incorporation of a taper increases pulse amplitude by a factor of 3.3.</p> <p>For the research in this thesis, these detectors are usually used with a differencing balun for geometric jitter cancellation. The type fabricated at JPL typically has active areas of \\(22 \\times 15 \\ \\mathrm{\\upmu m}\\), formed by a meander of 100 nm-wide and 5-nm-thick niobium nitride (NbN) nanowires on a 500 nm pitch (Fig.\u00a01 b). They are embedded in an efficiency-enhancing optical stack made of alternating layers of TiO\\(_2\\) and SiO\\(_2\\) and a gold mirror layer and typically have FWHM timing jitter of about 14 ps. The FW1%M jitter, which is a measure of the width of the jitter response function or histogram at 1% height, is an important metric for quantum or classical communication protocols that expect to reliably place photon timing measurements into time bins measured with respect to a clock. This is the case for pulsed Quantum Key Distribution and classical Pulse Position Modulation communication protocols. The differential single pixel SNSPDs exhibit FW1%M jitter of 49\u00a0ps.</p> <p>Impedance matching tapers can also help distinguish between instances when one or multiple photons are absorbed in the nanowire on a short timescale (\\(&lt; 100~\\mathrm{ps}\\)). The absorption of different numbers of photons results in variations in RF pulse height and slew rate (Fig.\u00a01 c). This phenomenon gives the detector photon number resolution (PNR), allowing the specific number of photons in an optical pulse to be measured. This is in contrast to the more common binary detection capability offered by conventional SNSPDs that only indicates if one or more photons are absorbed. Chapter 4 explores how the manifestation of photon number resolution in this detector type presents an issue for accurate time-correlated measurements of multi-photon light pulses. Once properly managed, both arrival time and photon number resolution may be resolved accurately, which is potentially useful for various quantum communication and computing applications.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Colangelo, M., Korzh, B., Allmaras, J.

Any stray photons from a laboratory environment can be coupled to these devices and produce a detection called a dark count or false count. Dark counts may be present in any situation where the detector is coupled to some experiment or apparatus outside the cryogenic environment. This coupling may be through windows inside the cryostat housing and radiation shields, or through optical fibers that carry single-mode signals directly to detectors.</p> <p>Visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photons are often the main sources of dark counts, because they are ubiquitous in a laboratory environment and are transmitted through common types of fibers and windows. Assuming visible light can be blocked from entering the detector system, the blackbody emission of the room temperature laboratory environment presents the primary source of dark counts. The spectrum of blackbody photons, defined by Planck\u2019s law, is peaked at about \\(10~\\mathrm{\\upmu m}\\), though it can contribute dark counts at significant rates up through near-infrared wavelengths.</p> <p>Without filtering in fiber or free-space, dark counts from blackbody emission will overload most SNSPDs and overpower the extremely faint signal of interest. In this work we investigate minimizing dark counts through the use of cryogenic free-space filtering.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_02/section_03_introduction/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Quantum communication applications require detection systems with performance optimized across 3 metrics: system detector efficiency, timing jitter and dark count rate. The dimensionless figure of merit \\(H\\) specifies this application-specific performance as \\(H = \\frac{\\eta}{(\\Delta t D)}\\) <sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Here, we focused on lowering the Dark Count Rate (DCR) of a telecom-band SNSPD system by filtering thermal photons, without sacrificing efficiency or jitter. We demonstrated a free-space coupled SNSPD with sub-0.1 Hz DCR, 14 ps timing jitter, and 72% total system detection efficiency (SDE) by using a differential single-pixel SNSPD <sup>2</sup> to image a single-mode fiber through an optimized free-space filter stack.</p> <p>  Figure 1: Filters and transmission spectra a) various optics and hardware used for free-space coupling inside the cryostat, including one of the Semrock bandpass filters (purple) </p> <p>The highest system detection efficiencies have been achieved using self-aligned fiber coupling where dark counts can be reduced using cryogenic fiber looping <sup>3</sup> or spliced narrow-band filters <sup>4</sup>. But it is difficult to achieve strong filtering without losses at the target wavelength. Low-loss, high-rejection filters are typically available as free-space components, so some of the highest reported H-values were achieved with cryogenic, fiber to free-space to fiber coupling, but exhibit an SDE of only a few percent <sup>5</sup>. The filtering method presented here takes advantage of commercially-available filters, achieves a high free-space coupling efficiency using a cryogenic lens, and is compatible with both fiber and free-space optical inputs.</p> <p>The system was designed around the use of two types of ultra-high-rejection custom short-pass filters, with two each having passbands below \\(1.6 \\mathrm{\\upmu m}\\) and \\(1.9 \\mathrm{\\upmu m}\\) (Andover Corp.). As shown in Fig.\u00a01 b, any mid-IR passbands of one filter complement a high rejection spectral region of the other. They reject wavelengths shorter than \\(3 \\ \\mathrm{\\upmu m}\\) through reflective optical coatings, and attenuate longer wavelengths through material absorption in the N-BK7 glass substrate. Since the filtering depends on the attenuation of the glass itself, the filters are unusually thick, measuring 12.7 mm.</p> <p>As initial modelling showed that 4 filters in series were required to sufficiently block mid-IR light, the cryostat design had to accommodate a set of filters several inches thick. This thickness, and the desire to couple to a single-mode fiber-compatible detector with low jitter, also necessitated the use of a cryogenic lens. A 1-inch diameter lens, if mounted outside the cryostat with a focal length surpassing the filter-stack thickness, could not have focused to a sufficiently small spot.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hadfield, R.

The effect bears resemblance to time walk observed in silicon avalanche diodes and other detectors where the pulses have varying heights and slew rates\u00a0<sup>8</sup>, thereby causing a timing measurement using a fixed threshold to \u2018walk\u2019 along the rising edge of the pulse (the labeled delay in Fig.\u00a01 a). At low count rates, SNSPDs exhibit very uniform pulse heights. However, at high count rates where the inter-arrival time is on the order of the reset time of the detector, current-reset and amplifier effects lead to smaller and distorted pulses. If photon inter-arrival times are not known a priori in the intended application, the uncorrected time walk manifests as a perceived increase in jitter (Fig.\u00a01 b).</p> <p>  Figure 1: Introduction to the time walk effect a) Diagram illustrating two major sources of correlated high count rate jitter. First, detections may occur during the reset time of a previous detection. At this time, the bias current in the nanowire is below its saturated value so that a photodetection triggers an RF pulse with correspondingly lower amplitude. Second, an RF pulse may arrive in the undershoot region of a previous pulse, where the undershoot is a period of negative voltage induced by the low-frequency cutoff properties of the readout amplifier chain. (b) Measured histograms of detections from short \\(3~\\mathrm{ps}\\) mode-locked laser pulses. With lower attenuation and higher count rate, the observed timing uncertainty is greater. Inset shows where respective count rates fall on a maximum count rate (MCR) curve <sup>9</sup>. The MCR of an SNSPD is often quoted at the \\(3~\\mathrm{dB}\\) point, where the normalized efficiency drops to \\(-3~\\mathrm{dB}\\) of its maximum value. The jitter increase due to time walk manifests as a tail in the instrument response functions (inside dashed black box) even at count rates significantly below the 3-dB point where detector efficiency has not started to drop significantly (e.g., the 1.7 Mcps data). </p> <p>The time-walk effect in SNSPDs is typically not reported, as jitter is usually measured at low count rates where the detector has ample time to reset following each detection. But as communication and quantum information applications push into higher count rates, the high count rate-induced jitter becomes more relevant. LIDAR, quantum and classical optical communication, and imaging applications may all benefit from the development of new detection systems and methods that keep jitter as low as possible in this regime.</p> <p>We first consider the features of SNSPD operation and readout that cause an increase in jitter with count rate. Then, we present multiple ways of mitigating or avoiding these effects before reviewing our preferred method that relies on a calibration and correction process.</p> <p>The jitter increase observed at high rate originates from two groups of system characteristics: (i) the intrinsic reset properties of the nanowire, and (ii) properties of the amplification chain. These influence the system\u2019s jitter differently, thus it is helpful to consider them separately. Added jitter from either or both sources can emerge when an SNSPD system is operated at high count rates.</p> <p>The nanowire reset process determines how the detector becomes single-photon sensitive again after a detection. When an SNSPD fires, the current flow in the nanowire momentarily drops to near zero, then recovers in an inverted exponential fashion (Fig.\u00a01 a). An incident photon may trigger another detection before the bias current fully returns to its saturated value, producing a pulse with a lower amplitude and slew rate. A fixed threshold comparator will trigger on this lower pulse later in time than a full amplitude pulse. If uncorrected for, this time walk manifests as an increase in jitter at high count rates.</p> <p>The choice of readout amplifiers may also contribute to added high count rate jitter. Pulses may be shifted in voltage and distorted if they arrive when the RF signal has not yet reached a steady zero state following the previous detection. For example, pulses may arrive within an amplifier-induced undershoot region following previous pulses. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig.\u00a01 a as the area below 0\u00a0mV. The duration of ringing or undershoot effects varies widely depending on the design of the readout circuit. If they last longer than the reset time of the nanowire bias current, the calibration technique may correct for the potentially complex interactions between pulse waveforms that overlap in time.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_03/section_03_introduction/#jitter-mitigation-methods-at-high-count-rates","title":"Jitter mitigation methods at high count rates","text":"<p>There are various methods for correcting increased jitter at high count rates. These include (i) the use of extra hardware that cancels out some distortions, or (ii) simple software-based data filtering that ignores distorted time-tags. We review these techniques before covering the calibration and correction approach.</p> <p>Variations in pulse height are a primary component of the distortions that appear at high rates. Such variations in other systems are commonly corrected with a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) that allows for triggering at a fixed percentage of pulse height rather than at a fixed voltage. Adding a CFD to an existing setup is straightforward for a single channel; however, it does require additional hardware such as multiple high-speed discriminators and a D-type flip-flop\u00a0<sup>10</sup>, which significantly increases the circuit complexity and power budget of a multi-channel system. In addition, CFDs are not expected to optimally correct for distortions of the pulse rising edge, which may arise from the overlap of one pulse with a signal reflection or undershoot features on the falling edge of a previous pulse. Multi-channel time-to-digital converters (TDCs) used to read out large SNSPD arrays typically only include fixed-threshold comparators\u00a0<sup>4</sup>.</p> <p>In a simple software-based jitter mitigation method, each time-tagged event may be accepted or rejected based on how soon it arrives after the previous pulse. Those that arrive within some pre-determined dead time are assumed to be corrupted by pulse distortions. These are rejected, and the rest are accepted. This method can lower system jitter and maintain high data rates, especially in the cases where only a few percent of pulses are filtered out. However, it can severely limit count rate near the \\(3~\\mathrm{dB}\\) point where the majority of counts are rejected (see the software deadtime section for details).</p> <p>Our correction method preserves original count rate and works with timing measurements from a fixed-threshold free-running TDC \u2013 the type that is often used for SNSPD readout. Pulse pileup correction techniques have been demonstrated with systems that fully digitize detector pulse waveforms\u00a0<sup>11</sup><sup>12</sup><sup>13</sup>. But capturing the fast rising edges of SNSPD pulses in this way would require very high sample rates and, subsequently, impractically large data streams. In contrast, our method assumes one timing measurement is acquired from triggering on the rising edge of each SNSPD pulse.</p> <p>We calculate the time between a given current SNSPD detection event and a preceding event. This inter-arrival time is used to determine a timing correction for the current event using a lookup table. A calibration routine described next is needed to build this lookup table. Applying these corrections during real-time processing removes deterministic delays correlated with the time between time-tags, leaving only stochastic jitter.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Chang, J., Los, J. W.

Fig.\u00a03 b shows that the correction method, derived from the 537.5 MHz calibration data, significantly reduces jitter when applied to detections from a 2.15\u00a0GHz pulse train. A similar jitter reduction can be demonstrated for repetition rates below 537.5\u00a0MHz.</p> <p>To study the effectiveness of our correction method at different count rates, we apply it to data collected at different mean photon numbers per pulse, with the same 537.5 MHz pulse train. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 c, the correction improves the FWHM at rates approaching the 3\u00a0dB point, and improves FW10%M and FW1%M (full width at ten percent/one percent maximum) dramatically, even at count rates significantly below the 3 dB point, where detector efficiency is nearly maximized. This reduction is evident in Fig.\u00a04 c, where the correction works to remove a time-walk induced tail in the instrument response function. The ratio of corrected FW1%M over uncorrected FW1%M reaches a minimum of 0.55 at a count rate of 11.5 MCounts/s. Therefore if an application sets its repetition rate or bin size based on the FW1%M metric, the repetition rate can be increased and the bin size decreased by up to 45% without any increase in event misattribution errors.

The PEACOQ is described in detail in Reference <sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>From early tests of the PEACOQ, it became evident that jitter increased dramatically at high single wire count rates. One of the overarching goals of the PEACOQ project was to demonstrate near-100\u00a0ps jitter at 1 GCount/s. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of applying time walk correction techniques to this detector. This began with collecting a calibration dataset like that discussed in the mode locked laser calibration section.</p> <p>A 1-GHz repetition rate 1550 nm mode locked laser was used (Pritel UOC) for calibration. The 1\u00a0GHz repetition rate was chosen so that uncorrected jitter even at the highest count rates (approaching 400 ps at the FW1%M), was smaller than the laser period. Then, each time tag may be matched to the timing of the original optical pulse. A dataset with a count rate of 20 MCounts/s was used for calibration. At this rate, there is a good balance of statistics available for \\(t'\\) ranging between 5 and 150 ns.</p> <p>The calibration process for the PEACOQ showed that high-rate pulse distortions are primarily due to amplifier effects and the overlap of RF pulses with the overshoot or ringing effects of previous RF pulses. This occurs because the PEACOQ was designed and fabricated to minimize the intrinsic reset time of the nanowire. The time it takes for bias current to re-saturate in the device is generally faster than the time for all amplifier effects to disappear following a previous RF pulse. Fig.\u00a01 b is the delay vs.\u00a0\\(t\u2019\\) curve derived from the calibration process. Unlike the the calibration figure from the first demonstration, the delay vs.\u00a0\\(t\u2019\\) curve for the PEACOQ shows features that are closely related to the falling edge of the RF pulse (Fig.\u00a01 a). In particular, the calibration curve shows a peak near 25 ns that aligns with an undershoot in the RF waveform caused by a reflection off a cryogenic amplifier. Future implementations of the PEACOQ will optimize the amplification chain to minimize RF reflections. Though even with such optimizations, it is likely that time-walk correction will improve high rate jitter.</p> <p>  Figure 1: PEACOQ RF pulse and calibration curve a) The RF pulse of one of the PEACOQ nanowires.

So multiple pulses can arrive in the time it takes one RF pulse to fully decay as seen by the timing electronics. Therefore, a given RF pulse can be level shifted not only by the presence of one pulse before, but even two or three before. The calibration and correction process was extended to correct a given pulse timing measurement based on two inter-pulse time measurements \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\) as shown in Fig.\u00a02 a.

For each \\(t'\\) there is a full range of possible \\(t''\\) times and vice versa, so the result of calibration becomes a 2D grid of delay corrections indexed by \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\). \\(t'\\) is always less than \\(t''\\) for the parameterization chosen, where both are measured from the latest or \u2018current\u2019 time tag (Fig.\u00a02 a). Therefore, the space of valid measurements is triangular as shown in Fig.\u00a02 b.</p> <p>  Figure 2: PEACOQ 2D calibration parameterization &amp; results a) A diagram showing how RF pulse waveforms can interfere additively, and how \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\) are parameterized. For illustrative purposes only. b) The result of 2nd order calibration, a grid of delay measurements indexed by \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\). The blue/red slices and corresponding graphs show how the the effect of varying \\(t''\\) for a given \\(t'\\) is similar to varying \\(t'\\) for a given \\(t''\\). </p> <p>Predominant features of the 2d calibration grid seem to be orthogonal and aligned to the axes. This is a result of the parametrization chosen for \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\). Features of the calibration that arise due to additive mixing of overlapped RF pulse waveforms manifest as orthogonal structures in the 2d-calibration grid.</p> <p>In the limit of large \\(t''\\), a slice of the calibration grid bears close resemblance to the \\(t'\\) vs delay curve used for 1D calibration and correction (Fig.\u00a01 b). Like in the 1D correction method, a delay correction can be found during real-time acquisition and processing by interpolating on a lookup table. Only now, the lookup table has an extra dependent variable \\(t''\\), and the interpolation is two dimensional.</p> <p>Proper handling of inter-pulse arrival measurements that fall outside the 2D grid is necessary for good correction performance. When both \\(t'\\) and \\(t''\\) fall outside the 2D grid, no correction is applied. When \\(t''\\) falls outside the grid but \\(t'\\) does not, a 1st order correction is applied to determine what delay must be subtracted to the current tag to correct its distortion. When both \\(t''\\) and \\(t'\\) fall within the 2d grid, a full 2d spline interpolation on the grid in Fig.\u00a02 b is applied to find the necessary delay correction.</p> <p>Like the 1st-order correction, the 2nd-order method makes the assumption that the delays to be corrected are small relative to the inter-pulse times \\(t\u2019\\) and \\(t\u2019\u2019\\).</p> <p>  Figure 3: PEACOQ single wire time-walk correction Jitter response functions for 3 count rates from one wire of the PEACOQ detector. </p> <p>Fig.\u00a03 shows how the 1st and 2nd order corrections improve jitter of the one wire of the PEACOQ detector tested. Each of these response functions have full width at half maximum (FWHM), full width at one tenth maximum (FW1/10M) and full width at one hundredth maximum (FW1/100M) metrics. The FW1/100M width is relevant for quantum communication applications that design the fundamental experiment repetition rate or bin size based on this metric. We plot how these metrics scale with count rate for the single nanowire as shown in Fig.\u00a04.</p> <p>  Figure 4: PEACOQ single wire width metrics Width metrics versus count rate. The FW1/100M metric benefits greatly from both the 1st and 2nd order time-walk correction.

With a long software-based dead time, data is filtered to keep only events for which the SNSPD was in a fully reset state prior to detection. This results in low jitter measurements even at high rate as shown in Fig.\u00a02 d where the dashed and solid (red, orange) lines are response functions of unfiltered and filtered data, respectively. However, the use of software-based dead times can severely limit usable count rate. This paradoxically contrasts with the main intended goal, which is to operate an SNSPD at the highest possible count rates. As shown in the Fig. 3b, adding a 100 ns software dead time to our WSi single pixel SNSPD limits its usable maximum count rate to about 4 MHz, while the raw count rate exceeds 10 MHz. Furthermore, the usable count rate drops to zero for higher incident photon rates, as the dead time starts to reject most events.

A key challenge in this work is closing a communication link over extremely large distances and high loss. For data transmission from a power-limited spacecraft to earth, this must be done with a restricted power budget, and therefore requires the use of photon efficient communication protocols that optimize the number of bits sent per unit of energy.</p> <p>In this chapter, we demonstrate high rate Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) applicable to future deep space communication. A transmitter sends an optical pulse in one of \\(2^M\\) possible time slots measured with respect to a clock. At a receiver, the arrival time of this pulse is measured to recover \\(M\\) bits of encoded data. Each successive set of \\(2^M\\) time slots following by a dead time constitute a PPM frame.</p> <p>The Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) project managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) demonstrates optical communication using PPM with the Psyche spacecraft from distances of 0.06 to 2.7 Au <sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>For larger M, more data may be sent with a single optical pulse or given spacecraft power budget. This is quantified through the photon information efficiency \\(c_p = C/E\\) where \\(C\\) is the link capacity</p> \\[ C=\\left(1-e^{-E}\\right) \\log _2 M, \\] <p>and \\(E\\) is the photon cost per optical pulse. DSOC relies on modulation of a CW seed laser to generate the communication signal on the spacecraft. This signal is then amplified by an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) which dominates the power budget of the spacecraft optical transmission system. Therefore, power consumption scales with the number of optical pulses sent.</p> <p>The DSOC project uses PPM with maximum M values of at least 5, meaning 5 bits of data are sent using 32 time slots per frame. M values as high as 19 have been demonstrated in the lab\u00a0<sup>2</sup>. The number of time bins needed per frame scales exponentially with the number of bits transmitted per pulse; therefore, for a given fixed clock rate and time bin duration, the PPM data rate decreases dramatically for higher M values.</p> <p>We demonstrate a high clock rate PPM protocol in the lab based on modulating a mode-locked laser and receiving pulses with a low jitter superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) (Fig.\u00a01 (a)). We focus on demonstrating moderately high PIE, while also increasing the clock rate of the sytem by an order of magnitude relative to the DSOC platform (from 2\u00a0GHz to 20\u00a0GHz). By operating at both higher clock rate and PIE than DSOC, this system exemplifies how future iterations of DSOC may send data more quickly but also over greater distances with the same power budget.</p> <p>The rate increase is possible due to recent advancements in Niobium Nitride SNSPDs\u00a0<sup>4</sup>. These achieve low jitter performance by incorporating impedance matching tapers for efficient RF coupling, resulting in higher slew rate pulses, and by enabling RF pulse readout from both ends of the nanowire. The dual-ended readout allows for the cancellation of jitter caused by the variable location of photon arrival along the meander when the differential signals are recombined with a balun. These detectors achieve jitter as low as 50 ps at the FW(1/100)M level, making them suitable for the demonstration of PPM with 50 ps slot widths and a 20 GHz clock.</p> <p>  Figure 1: PPM modulation and experiment setup a) Diagram of the experimental setup.

Fig.\u00a02 zooms in on the rising edge outlined in red here. </p> <p>However, these detectors exhibit a photon number dependent response that affects the time-correlated measurements needed for high-rate PPM. This behavior, shown in Fig.\u00a02 also gives the detector photon number resolution (PNR) \u2014 a property that is desirable in certain applications including quantum communication and quantum computing. The SNSPD generates RF pulses with greater amplitude and slew rate when detecting optical pulses with multiple photons. Photon number effects are especially evident in this lower jitter variety of SNSPD due to the use of impedance matching tapers which more efficiently couple energy out of the nanowire and into the readout circuit. With high resolution time tagging equipment, photon number dependent effects have even been observed in SNSPDs not necessarily designed to exhibit it <sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup> like those without tapers <sup>7</sup>. Therefore it is increasingly likely that future research involving low-jitter SNSPDs and multiphoton pulsed sources will have to explicitly manage the PNR response for accurate time-correlated measurements \u2013 whether the effect it is desired or not.</p> <p>For the tapered differential detectors, the PNR response affects timing of fixed threshold timetags at any trigger level (Fig.\u00a02). However, at lower trigger levels the PNR response is less pronounced and the timing measurements are less affected. Therefore, we divide a single SNSPD readout line using an RF splitter and trigger on the RF pulse at a high and low level as shown by the red lines in Fig.\u00a02. This gives partially conjugate information on optical pulse arrival time and photon number. From these measurements we study the PNR response in detail and present two methods for managing it. We demonstrate how the photon number information may be deconvolved from the arrival time information, and how both de-correlated degrees of freedom can be extracted simultaneously. This enables the original goal of high rate PPM, but also informs how low-jitter photon number resolving SNSPDs can be used in other classical communication and quantum applications.</p> <p>  Figure 2: PNR-sensitive pulse waveform The rising edge of the differential SNSPD\u2019s RF pulses exhibit variations in height, slew rate, and arrival time due to photon-number dependent dynamics. The slopes of the 1-photon and 2-photon pulses significantly differ, and as the photon number increases, the alterations to the pulse shape become progressively smaller. Trigger levels A (8\u00a0mV) and B (50\u00a0mV) were used to extract as much information about pulse slope and arrival time as possible. </p>"},{"location":"chapter_04/section_03_introduction/#development-of-a-modulation-source","title":"Development of a modulation source","text":"<p>We produce our PPM signal by carving a 1550\u00a0nm high rate mode locked laser with lithium niobate modulators.

A short PM fiber from the SHG module connects to a nonlinear crystal generating photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) module separates the photon pair spectrum into eight 13\u00a0nm-wide bands around 1530 and 1550 nm for the signal and idler photon, respectively. The signal and idler are directed to the Bob and Alice stations, respectively. The readout interferometers introduce the same time delay as the source interferometer. Polarization controllers are used to maximize the coincidence rates, as the detection efficiencies of each SNSPD is polarization sensitive (\\(\\pm20%\\)). Entanglement visibility is unaffected by readout polarization. 100 GHz spacing Dense wavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) modules are used to direct each frequency channel into a distinct fiber. Two superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are used to measure a specific frequency multiplexed channel pair. Measurements for different multiplexed channels are performed in succession to resolve full system performance. b) ITU channels used in the experiment. Pairs of channels highlighted with the same color obey the phase and pump-energy matching condition for SPDC. To assess the full 16 channels (27-42) of Alice\u2019s DWDM multiplexer, Bob\u2019s 8-channel DWDM is replaced with a narrowband filter with tunable resonance frequency (not shown in figure). </p> <p>Entangled photons play a vital role in the development of quantum information processing and communication systems\u00a0<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>. The ability to generate entangled photon pairs at a high rate is essential for establishing reliable and scalable quantum networks with quantum repeaters, as well as for implementing entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) systems\u00a0<sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>10</sup>. Unlike QKD implementations that rely on attenuated lasers\u00a0<sup>11</sup><sup>12</sup>, entanglement distribution systems may fulfill the objectives of QKD while also serving as the foundation for advanced quantum networks that rely on entanglement as a fundamental resource.</p> <p>Entanglement distribution and entanglement-based QKD have been demonstrated with impressive performance across a number of metrics. These include 40\u00a0kbps data rates in a QKD system deployed over 50\u00a0km of fiber\u00a0<sup>17</sup> as well as multiple polarization-entangled sources that leverage spectral multiplexing. These polarization sources include a demonstration of 181 kebits/s across 150 ITU channel pairs and a high-throughput source potentially capable of gigabit rates with many added channels and detectors <sup>18</sup><sup>19</sup>. Multiple works have highlighted the need to leverage high total brightness, spectral brightness, collection efficiency, and visibility from pair-generating non-linear crystals to realize practical high-rate entanglement distribution\u00a0<sup>19</sup><sup>20</sup><sup>21</sup><sup>22</sup><sup>23</sup><sup>24</sup><sup>25</sup>.</p> <p>A time-bin entangled photon source has certain advantages over a polarization-based system\u00a0<sup>26</sup>. Time-bin entanglement can be measured with no moving hardware and does not require precise polarization tracking to maximize visibility\u00a0<sup>27</sup><sup>28</sup>. Also, with suitable equipment, robust time-bin modulation is possible over free space links with turbulence\u00a0<sup>29</sup>. Therefore, the possibility of simplified fiber-to-free-space interconnects and larger quantum networks based on a shared time-bin protocol motivates development of improved time-bin sources. Furthermore, time-bin encoding is suited for single-polarization light-matter interfaces <sup>30</sup><sup>31</sup>.</p> <p>We direct 4.09 GHz mode-locked laser light into a nonlinear crystal via 80-ps delay-line interferometers (12.5 GHz free-spectral range) to realize a high-rate entanglement source. The ability to resolve time-bin qubits into 80\u00a0ps wide bins is enabled by newly developed low-jitter differential superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs)\u00a0<sup>32</sup>. Wavelength multiplexing is used to realize multiple high-visibility channel pairings which together sum to a high coincidence rate. Each of the pairings can be considered an independent carrier of photonic entanglement\u00a0<sup>33</sup><sup>34</sup> and therefore the system as a whole is applicable to flex-grid architectures through the use of wavelength selective switching <sup>35</sup><sup>36</sup>. However, we focus on maximizing the rate between two receiving stations, Alice and Bob (Fig.\u00a01 a). Each station is equipped with a DWDM that separates the frequency multiplexed channel into multiple fibers for detection. The SNSPDs are used with a real-time pulse pileup and time-walk correction technique\u00a0<sup>37</sup> to keep jitter low even at high count rates.</p> <p>We quantify per-channel brightness and visibility as a function of pump power, as well as collection efficiencies, coincidence rates across 8 channel pairs, and expected performance of a partially realized 16-channel pair configuration. We show that the 8 channel system achieves visibilities that average to 99.3% at low mean photon number \\(\\mu_{L} = 5.6{\\times} 10^{-5}\\,\\pm\\,9{\\times} 10^{-6}\\). At a higher power (\\(\\mu_{H} = 5.0{\\times} 10^{-3}\\,\\pm\\,3{\\times} 10^{-4}\\)), we demonstrate a total coincidence rate of 3.55 MHz with visibilities that average to 96.6%. Through quantum state tomography we bound the distillable entanglement rate of the system to between 69% and 91% of the \\(\\mu_{H}\\) coincidence rate (2.46 - 3.25 Mebits/s).</p> <p>Quantifying a source\u2019s spectral mode purity is important for gauging its utility in advanced quantum networks that rely on interferometric measurements like two-photon interference which enables Bell-state measurements (BSM)\u00a0<sup>38</sup>.</p> <p>With Schmidt decomposition we quantify the modal purity of single DWDM channel pairs and derive the inverse Schmidt number which serves as an estimate for two-photon interference visibility between two such sources. Ultimately, we demonstrate that an entanglement generation source of this design makes for a robust and powerful building block for future high-rate quantum networks.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Nielsen, M.

The up-converted pulses at 769 nm have a FWHM bandwidth of 243 GHz (0.48 nm), which, along with the phase matching condition of the SPDC waveguide, defines a wide joint spectral intensity (JSI) function\u00a0<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>The photon pairs, which are separated by a coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM), are of the form \\(|\\psi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|e\\rangle_{s}|e\\rangle_{i}+e^{i \\phi}|l\\rangle_{s}|l\\rangle_{i}\\right)\\). Entangled idler and signal photons are sent to the receiving stations labeled Alice and Bob, respectively. One readout interferometer at each station projects all spectral bands into a composite time-phase basis. From here, dense wavelength division multiplexers (DWDM) divide up the energy-time entangled photon pairs into spectral channels.</p> <p>DWDM outputs are sent to differential niobium nitride (NbN) single pixel SNSPDs\u00a0<sup>3</sup> with 22 \u00d7 15\u00a0\u00b5m active areas formed by meanders of 100-nm-wide and 5-nm-thick niobium nitride (NbN) nanowires on a 500\u00a0nm pitch. These measure the arrival time of photons with respect to a clock signal derived from the mode-locked laser. Use of the high system repetition rate and compact 80\u00a0ps delay interferometers is only possible due to the high timing resolution of these detectors. Low jitter performance is achieved by incorporating impedance matching tapers for efficient RF coupling, resulting in higher slew rate pulses, and by enabling RF pulse readout from both ends of the nanowire. The dual-ended readout allows for the cancellation of jitter caused by the variable location of photon arrival along the meander when the differential signals are recombined with a balun. We use two SNSPDs for this demonstration with efficiencies at 1550\u00a0nm of 66% and 74%. A full 8-channel implementation of this system would require 16 detectors operating in parallel at both Alice and Bob. To read out both outputs of both interferometers, 4 detectors per channel are required, resulting in 32 detectors total.</p> <p>A novel time-walk or pulse-pileup correction technique is used to extract accurate measurements of SNSPD pulses that arrive between 23 and 200\u00a0ns after a previous detection on the same RF channel. Without special handling of these events, timing jitter will suffer due to RF pulse amplitude variations and pileup effects. As detailed in the time walk correction section, the correction method works by subtracting off predictable timing distortions based on the inter-arrival time that precedes them\u00a0<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>. An in-situ calibration process is used to build a lookup table that relates corrections and inter-arrival time. At the highest achievable pump power, this correction method leads to 320% higher coincidence rates compared to a data filtering method that rejects all distorted events arriving within \\(\\simeq\\) 200\u00a0ns of a previous pulse.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_05/section_04_system_results/#results","title":"Results","text":"<p>By pairing up particular 100\u00a0GHz DWDM channels and recording coincidence rates, a discretized form of the JSI of our pair source is measured (Fig.\u00a01 a). Due to the wide pump bandwidth, the spectrum of signal photons spans several ITU channels for a given idler photon wavelength. Pairs along the main diagonal are optimized for maximum coincidence rates by tuning the pump laser frequency and are therefore used for all remaining measurements. In (b) of the system figure, these pairs are highlighted with matching colors. Coupling efficiencies \\(\\eta\\) shown in Fig.\u00a01 a are derived from a JSI fitting analysis and include all losses between the generation of entangled pairs in the SPDC and final photo-detection.</p> <p>A joint spectral analysis of the 100\u00a0GHz filters applied to the wide-bandwidth pumped JSI shows only a fraction of idler (signal) photons that pass through one filter will be detected with their corresponding signal (idler) photon. This is true even for ideal filters that are 100% transmissive within their passbands, which demonstrates a geometrical limit on the ratio of coincidence rates to singles rates in this regime of large bandwidth JSI and narrowband filters. For calculations of \\(\\mu\\) in terms of the coincidence rate \\(C_{AB}\\), repetition rate \\(R\\), and singles rates \\(S_A, S_B\\), we account for this by adding a geometric compensation factor \\(\\delta\\) to the commonly used equation:</p> \\[ \\begin{align} \\mu =  \\frac{\\delta S_A S_B}{R C_{AB}}. \\end{align} \\] <p>This gives a definition of \\(\\mu\\) for the JSI region where signal and idler filters overlap according to energy conservation, and the probability of transmitting entangled pairs to both Alice and Bob is not negligible. It is valid in the low \\(\\mu\\) regime where generation of higher order photon number states from the SPDC are rare. For filter pairings along the main diagonal in Fig.\u00a01 a, values for \\(\\delta\\) are fairly consistent and average to \\(\\delta = 0.393 \\pm 0.012\\). The derivation of \\(\\delta\\) is detailed in the \\(\\mu\\) estimate section.</p> <p>  Figure 1: Joint spectral intensity measurements and histogram a) The singles rates at Alice \\(S_A\\) and Bob \\(S_B\\) (grey bars), path coupling efficiencies (purple bars), and coincidence rates \\(C_{AB}\\) (black text in colored boxes) for different DWDM channel pairings. All measurements are recorded at a SHG pump power of 14.6\u00a0mW, for which \\(\\mu\\) of the channel pairs along the main diagonal are shown in red text. The joint spectral intensity envelop spans several 100 GHz channels. As detailed in the coincidence rate section, the coincidence rates (kHz, black) are scaled to represent two branches of the total wavefunction, so that they are consistent with the coupling efficiencies \\(\\eta\\) (purple bars) and the singles rates (grey bars). There are four branches for each pairing of the four interferometer output ports. In practice, one output each of Alice and Bob\u2019s interferometers is measured, thereby capturing one branch. See the JSI modelling section section for details on the fitting method used to solve for the coupling efficiencies \\(\\eta\\). b) Coincidence rates for energy-matched channel pairings. The light green bars depict the main diagonal in (a). Grey bars are measured with x16 DWDM at Alice and a tunable narrowband filter at Bob. Dashed bars predict the rates for a system with x16 DWDMs at both Alice and Bob c) Histogram of photon arrival events with respect to the 4.09 GHz clock. Dashed black and grey lines show the response functions for coincidence events. Red bars represent guard regions where coincidence events are ignored. Events within 10\u00a0ps guard regions centered at 80 and 160\u00a0ps (shaded red) are discarded for analysis of coincidences between individual bins. This is done to maximize visibility in the presence of some minor overlap of pulses (see the guard region section for details). </p> <p>In the following, rigorous tests of entanglement are primarily conducted with the 8 ITU 100 GHz channel pairings: Ch. 35-42 at Alice and Ch. 52-49 at Bob. However, in Fig.\u00a01 b we investigate rates across 16 pairs by using all 16 channels available on the DWDM at Alice (24 \u2014 34) and a tunable narrowband filter in place of the DWDM at Bob. As the narrowband filter has higher loss and 45\u00a0GHz FWHM passband (see the filter bandwidths section for measurements), the coincidence rates are lower (grey bars in Fig.\u00a01 b). However, the uniformity of coincidence rates across 16 channels implies that the use of 16-channel DWDMs at both Alice and Bob would roughly double the total coincidence rate.</p> <p>Signals from the SNSPDs are directed to a free-running time tagger (Swabian) and processed with custom software. The resulting histograms, referenced from a shared clock ( Fig.\u00a01 c), depict three peaks, which are caused by the sequential delays of the source and readout interferometers. Some intensity imbalance between long and short paths is present in these interferometers, which explains the asymmetry between early and late peaks in Fig.\u00a01 c.\u00a0Such imbalances are present in both the source and readout interferometers to varying degrees. The interferometer used for the source exhibits an early/late intensity balance ratio of 1.13. Alice and Bob\u2019s interferometers exhibit early/late imbalances of 1.24 and 1.15, respectively. An analysis of how this type of imbalance affects entanglement visibility is included in the interferometer imbalance section.</p> <p>The coincidence rate across Alice and Bob\u2019s middle bins varies sinusoidally with respect to the combined phase relationship of the source and readout interferometers (see the tomography section section.)\u00a0<sup>6</sup><sup>1</sup>. In Fig.\u00a01 c, the coincidences shown are for any combination of early, middle, or late bins. For tomography and visibility measurements, coincidence detections across specific bin pairings are considered.</p> <p>  Figure 2: Entanglement visibility and rates vs pump power a) Visibility versus pump power. Error bars are calculated by taking multiple measurements of the center bin coincidence rate over some integration time. These measurements span small ranges of interferometer phase, as the extremum-finding algorithm jitters the interferometer voltage. b) Bounded distillable entanglement rate versus pump power. Multiple such measurements are made for all the tomographic measurements. These are used to calculate standard deviations for visibility, log negativity, and coherent information. Error bars for the log negativity and coherent information are smaller than the line width shown. Rates shown assume readout of all 4 available interferometer ports, based on data measured using one port each at Alice and Bob. </p> <p>Due to the small size and temperature insensitivity of the interferometers, minimal temporal phase drift is observed over multiple hours. Nevertheless, software is used to lock the phase at a minimum or maximum with a simple hill-climbing algorithm. This varies the phase by small amounts over several minutes to search for, or maintain, an extremum.</p> <p>Channels 35 and 59 are chosen for an analysis of entanglement visibility and rates versus pump power. Visibility, with respect to pump power or mean entangled pair rate, is shown in Fig.\u00a02 a. We define the entanglement visibility as \\(V = 100\\%\\*(C*{max} - C*{min})/(C*{max} + C*{min})\\) where \\(C*{min}\\) and \\(C*{max}\\) are the minimum and maximum coincidence rates in the middle bin for varied phase. As this coincidence rate depends on the total phase across the source and readout interferometers, only Bob\u2019s interferometer is actively controlled to scan the full state space.</p> <p>The raw visibility versus \\(\\mu\\) is shown in blue in Fig.\u00a02 a. Relative to similar measurements <sup>7</sup>, this drops quickly with increasing \\(\\mu\\), and one reason is the presence of accidental coincidences across mutually incompatible spectral modes. The presence of these unwanted coincidences is a consequence of the narrowband filtering regime and depends on factors including the singles rates \\(S_A\\) and \\(S_B\\), and the geometric compensation factor \\(\\delta\\) (see the incompatible bases section for derivation). We model this type of accidental coincidence rate \\(C*{Acc}\\) versus \\(\\mu\\) and subtract it off from coincidence measurements to produce the grey data in Fig.\u00a02 a. This simulated visibility\u2019s more gradual drop with an increasing \\(\\mu\\) highlights the detrimental effect of our high single-to-coincidence rates \\(S_A/C*{AB}\\), \\(S_B/C*{AB}\\). As detailed in the discussion section that follows, this motivates special source engineering techniques for future systems.</p> <p>  Figure 3: Visibilities and rates for 8 channel pairs a) Visibility for the main 8 channel pairs, measured at a high (22.9\u00a0mW) and a low (0.21\u00a0mW) SHG pump power setting. Each power setting results in similar \\(\\mu\\) for all channels: \\(\\mu_L = 5.6{\\times}10^{-5} \\pm 9{\\times}10^{-6}\\) and \\(\\mu_H = 5.0{\\times}10^{-3} \\pm 3{\\times}10^{-4}\\). b) Rate metrics for the 8 channel pairs at the same high and low power settings. The range of possible values for distillable entanglement rate is spanned by the yellow regions, bounded above by log-negativity and below by coherent information. Rates shown assume readout of all 4 available interferometer ports, based on data measured using one port each at Alice and Bob </p> <p>We quantify the rate of useful entanglement by supplying bounds for the distillable entanglement rate \\(C_D\\). Measured in ebits/s, \\(C_D\\) is the maximal asymptotic rate of Bell-pair production per coincidence using only local operations and classical communications <sup>8</sup><sup>9</sup>. It is bounded above by log-negativity \\(C_N = C_{AB} E_N\\) and below by coherent information \\(C_I = C_{AB} E_I\\) <sup>8</sup>. For each pump power setting in Fig.\u00a02, a series of tomographic measurements is performed and density matrices are calculated. The values of \\(E_I\\) and \\(E_N\\) are calculated from the density matrices as detailed in the tomography section.</p> <p>Fig.\u00a03 shows visibilities, raw coincidence rates, and bounded distillable entanglement rates for two pump powers and all 8 channel pairings. The highest pump power is currently limited by our EDFA-amplified SHG module. The pump power in principle could be increased until the SNSPD efficiency drops due to saturation, and the net coincidence rate plateaus. Without the time-walk correction, high-rate jitter becomes an issue well before the gradual drop of SNSPD efficiency. At the \\(\\mu_H\\) (22.9\u00a0mW) power, the singles rates \\(S_A, S_B\\) average to 3.84 MHz, for which SNSPD efficiencies are about 78% of nominal.</p> <p>Using the data in Fig.\u00a01 a, we model the JSI for our pair source as a product of pump envelope and phase matching condition functions</p> \\[ |f(\\omega_s, \\omega_i)|^2 = |\\psi_{\\mathrm{ph}}\\left(\\omega_s, \\omega_i\\right)|^2 *|\\psi_p\\left(\\omega_s, \\omega_i\\right)|^2, \\] <p>which depends on the wavelength (769.78 nm) and bandwidth (243 GHz FWHM) of up-converted light out of the SHG, measured with a spectrum analyzer. The path efficiencies from SPDC to detectors are also fitted based on integrations over the JSI that model the DWDM transmission passbands (see the JSI analysis section for details).</p> <p>We calculate the Schmidt decomposition of the pair source JSI, taking into account the DWDM filters at Alice and Bob, and derive an average inverse Schmidt number \\(1/K\\) of \\(0.87\\). This value quantifies the spectral purity of the entangled photon source and is theoretically equivalent to the visibility of a two-source HOM (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interferogram\u00a0<sup>10</sup>.

Still, there is potential to increase rates beyond those measured here with some straightforward changes to the setup. First, a higher power EDFA-amplified SHG module or tapered amplifier may be used. With this, we predict a single channel pair could sustain rates up to those specified in the first column of Table 1. Our measurements of 8 channel and 16 channel configurations imply the approximately multiplicative scalings in columns 2 and 3, as coincidence rates of these channel pairs are all within 27% of each other. From measurements of the SPDC spectrum, it is also possible to extrapolate rates to a 60-channel 100 GHz DWDM configuration that includes channels spanning the L, C, and S ITU bands. This configuration could sustain a 34.9 MHz total coincidence rate and a distillable entanglement rate between 27.7 (\\(C_N\\)) and 15.9 Mebits/s (\\(C_I\\)).

The high singles rates lead to accidental coincidences from mutually incompatible spectral modes that lower visibility and load the detectors with useless counts. However, there is potential to mitigate these extra counts by embedding the nonlinear crystal undergoing SPDC in a cavity that enhances emission at the center frequencies of multiple DWDM channels\u00a0<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>. Also, there are other approaches to achieving such intensity islands that require dispersion engineering\u00a0<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup>. With such periodically enhanced emission, the resulting JSI would exhibit a series of intensity islands lying along the energy-matching anti-diagonal, easily separable with DWDMs at Alice and Bob. The photon flux for each channel would originate primarily from these islands covered by both signal and idler DWDM passbands, resulting in a higher ratio of coincidences to singles.

A threshold timing measurement set at a specific trigger level will \u2018walk\u2019 along the rising edge of SNSPD pulses by varying amounts if those pulses vary in amplitude and slew rate. At low count rates, SNSPDs exhibit very uniform pulse heights and shapes. However, at high count rates where the inter-arrival time is on the order of the reset time of the detector, current-reset and amplifier effects lead to smaller and distorted pulses in a form of pulse \u2018pile-up\u2019\u00a0<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>  Figure 1: Time walk effect vs dead time rejection a) Adding 200\u00a0ns dead time (DT) to avoid high-rate jitter significantly reduces count rates at higher \\(\\mu\\). With time walk correction (TWC), the full available count rate is preserved while keeping the timing jitter low. b) The reduction in count rate for coincidences is more dramatic, because the lost efficiency at both detectors contributes. </p> <p>The effects of time walk can be filtered out by imposing a dead time following each detection. The length of the dead time is tuned so that SNSPD events arriving within it are expected to have distorted timing and are thrown out. However, as shown in Fig.\u00a01, this method can severely limit count and coincidence rates for detector types that exhibit long periods of undershoot or ringing on the falling edge of the RF pulse. For the differential SNSPDs used here, a 200\u00a0ns dead time would be necessary to filter out all time-walk effects.</p> <p>As detailed in <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>, a calibration and correction process may be used to cancel out the effects of time walk without losing count rate. It relies on adding timing corrections \\(\\tilde{d}\\) to time-distorted SNSPD time tags based on the inter-arrival time \\(t'\\) that precedes each tag. Building a lookup table for \\(\\tilde{d}\\) as a function of \\(t'\\) is the objective of the calibration process. With this, real-time running software may largely cancel the increase in jitter from time-walk.</p> <p>Here we introduce a simplification of the calibration process from <sup>1</sup> that makes use of the pulse sequence already impinging on the detectors from the entanglement source. With the calibration routine written directly into our coincidence analysis software, recomputing the ideal \\(t'\\)-vs-\\(\\tilde{d}\\) curve takes no more than a few seconds whenever the detector bias currents or trigger levels are changed.</p> <p>We have previously shown how the \\(t'\\)-vs-\\(\\tilde{d}\\) curve can be found by illuminating the detector with photons from a pulsed laser source <sup>1</sup>. We imposed the requirement that the period \\(p\\) of the pulse sequence be larger than the largest expected jitter observed due to time walk. This way, any time-tag can be unambiguously associated with the timing of the laser pulse that created it, thereby inferring the relation between \\(t'\\) and \\(\\tilde{d}\\) for that event.</p> <p>Here we rely on a 2D histogram (Fig.\u00a02 a) that plots \\(t'\\) on the y-axis and the usual clock-referenced arrival time on the x-axis. Here, any single \\(t'\\) and absolute arrival time measurement does not imply a correction \\(\\tilde{d}\\) when considered in isolation. This is because the time-distribution is an irregular pattern of histogram peaks of varying height, as opposed to a more uniform sequence. Also, delays \\(\\tilde{d}\\) can surpass the experiment\u2019s fundamental period (244.5\u00a0ps from the laser\u2019s 4.09\u00a0GHz rep rate), initially complicating the matching of trigger events to originating photon timing. But despite these nuances, the 2D histogram structure implies a method for extracting the \\(t'\\)-vs-\\(\\tilde{d}\\) calibration curve through a special analysis.</p> <p>Slices at the bottom of the 2D histogram (Fig.\u00a02 a) for large \\(t'\\) are essentially identical to the low-count-rate 3-peak singles histograms like from Fig. system:1c. As \\(t'\\) decreases from here, the slice as a whole develops some linear offset or rollover (periodic every 244.5\u00a0ps). This offset is the \\(\\tilde{d}\\) offset of interest. Therefore, \\(t'\\)-vs-\\(\\tilde{d}\\) may be extracted by running a template matching algorithm on each horizontal slice, using the large-\\(t'\\) slice as the template. We opt for an absolute differences algorithm (Fig.\u00a02 b). As the algorithm progresses to smaller and smaller \\(t'\\), the offset may approach the fundamental period length and \u2018roll over,\u2019 causing a jump-discontinuity. But this can be detected and corrected for, meaning the method may produce a \\(t'\\)-vs-\\(\\tilde{d}\\) curve (Fig.\u00a02 c) with some \\(\\tilde{d}\\) larger than the fundamental period.</p> <p>  Figure 2: In situ time walk analysis a) The 2d histogram with clock-referenced histograms on the x-axis and inter-pulse arrival time \\(t'\\) on the y-axis. The effect of time walk is evident in the horizontal translations of the 3-peak structure as \\(t'\\) decreases. Slices of the 2D histogram indicated by the red and blue horizontal line are plotted as regular histograms in the lower figure. b) After applying the Sum Absolute Differences filter to horizontal slices of the 2D histogram. The \\(t'-vs-\\tilde{d}\\) delay curve (c) is extracted from this by using the index of each row with minimum mismatch value as the \\(\\tilde{d}\\) value for that row. </p> <p>Overall, time-walk analysis based on the 2D histogram construction is straightforward to implement and user friendly because it may be applied in situ as part of software that already creates histograms and records coincidences.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_05/section_07_experiment_details/#filter-bandwidths","title":"Filter bandwidths","text":"<p>Fig.\u00a03 shows the transmission spectra of one 100\u00a0GHz DWDM filter and the tunable narroband filter used for the 16-channel source brightness study.</p> <p>  Figure 3: DWDM and tunable narroband filter bandwidths Spectrums for a single DWDM channel and narroband filter, with the center wavelengths set to zero.

The low dark count free space coupling project and the PPM project were partially motivated by planned improvements to deep space optical communication systems. The time-walk correction project grew naturally out of issues with SNSPD tagging that were observed in other projects. Finally, the high rate entanglement project resulted from an interest in using the differential single pixel SNSPDs to their full potential in a quantum application.</p> <p>One prevailing observation from this body of work is that lessons and insights gained from each project have utility beyond the motivations that led to the project itself. These insights can be oddly general and specific at the same time. They do not necessarily align with the delineations usually used to categorize research for one goal versus another. This is how, for example, observations from a project on deep space optical communication can be used to improve the performance of a quantum entanglement source.</p> <p>Here we state predominant insights gained from the four major projects of this thesis:</p> <ol> <li> <p>From the low dark count rate free space coupling project, we learn that the use of free space optics inside a cryogenic environment is not necessarily as unwieldy as one might expect. Optics inside a cryostat cannot be directly aligned without expensive actuators that may or may not function and very low temperatures. But there are ways around this, like by moving all alignment controls outside the fridge and coupling in though windows. Such designs may even have dark count rates comparable or superior to fiber coupled SNSPD systems, as we demonstrate.</p> </li> <li> <p>The time-walk correction project demonstrated how effective SNSPDs continue to be even at high count rates where their RF pulses overlap. Researchers may initially assume that the high count rate behavior of SNSPDs is \u2018complicated\u2019 or \u2018corrupted,\u2019 and that the detectors fail to operate well in this regime. But we have found, with the calibration and correction methodology, that they continue to respond predictably and with good jitter up to rates where the bias current has insufficient time to recover, thereby reducing the detector efficiency. Depending on the types of amplifiers used, time-walk effects can dramatically reduce jitter before the detector has lost even a few percent of its efficiency due to incomplete bias-current reset. Therefore, time-walk correction can easily lead to 2-3 times higher usable count rates for single detectors, and up to an order of magnitude higher rates in quantum applications that rely on multi-detector coincidences.</p> </li> <li> <p>The PPM project demonstrated the complexity and potential utility of the photon number response in the differential single pixel SNSPDs. For better or worse, the ideal application of these detectors from quantum or classical communication will require nuanced digital processing methods. When not planned for, the PNR effects can be a nuisance. But when properly managed, it makes these detectors into highly effective photon number resolving devices \u2014 equivalent to a large array of binary-type SNSPDs. This will be useful for various photon heralding applications, and for commissioning of complex multi-photon states of light. We introduced the GMM method for PPM decoding, based on a general sense that working in a high dimensional space for event attribution will continue to be a fruitful approach for future work. SNSPD readout will only become more complex with the emergence of multiplexed arrays and ulta-high count rate versions. Effects like time-walk the phon number dependent response may be easier to understand and manage it they are thought of as simply modifying how detector data appears when graphed in a high dimensional space.</p> </li> <li> <p>Work on the high rate entanglement system highlighted how important it is to intelligently manage a complex experiment. By transitioning a time-bin entanglement source to a high repetition rate compatible with the differential single pixel detectors, some aspects became simpler (relative to a low-repetition rate system), and others became more complicated. The promise of this project then hinged on managing the complex aspects reliably. One major advantage of the high repetition rate was it allowed us to use small and highly stable interferometers. With lower repetition rate time-bin entanglement sources, precise temperature control of interferometers is needed when their path length delay exceeds multiple nanoseconds <sup>1</sup>. Here we were able to use interferometers with a path length delay of just 80\u00a0ps, which varied in phase by less than a few degrees over multiple hours. On the other hand, the high rate system required time-walk correction for the SNSPDs in order to operate the system at state-of-the art rates. Enabling this correction method in a full system was a new challenge, and it brought about the much more elegant in-situ calibration method. The improved and mostly automated procedure for cancelling SNSPD time walk added minimal complexity for the system user, and further supported the move towards high repetition rate sources for emerging quantum networks.</p> </li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Valivarthi, R., Davis, S.

The idler-arm fiber coupling stands in for whatever type of output coupling is required for the application. </p> <p>We propose a design for a future SPDC &amp; SNSPD system that supports high-rate heralding of a range of idler frequencies from a cavity-enhanced SPDC all onto a single SNSPD array. We envision pumping the pair generating crystal in free space and then coupling one arm to an SNSPD array, also in free-space, with the whole setup located inside a cryostat with the detector.</p> <p>The signal arm is reflected off a diffraction grating, which separates different signal frequencies into different spatial modes imaged onto the SNSPD. This makes for a compact system that should have excellent SPDC - detector coupling efficiency. All the lessons learned about high rate PNR heralding could be incorporated into this array, including time-walk correction as well as accurate simultaneous arrival time and photon number attribution.</p> <p>This design could be adapted for use in entanglement-based QKD, for a high-rate single photon source <sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup>, as part of a heralded EPR/entanglement source <sup>4</sup>, or for preparation of non-Gaussian states <sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>. For heralded single photon and entangled pair sources, the spectral multiplexed herald design supports certain methods for increasing output rates without sacrificing state purity <sup>7</sup><sup>8</sup>. One of the issues facing the development of linear optics quantum computing is the lack of such high-rate high purity sources of non-Gaussian states of light, such a single-photon states. Heralded sources of entanglement are related, and there is a promising path towards demonstrating these at high rate. This is needed because the entanglement distribution system from chapter 5, and all other such systems, must operate at low pump power and low mean photon number \\(\\mu\\) in order to minimize the detrimental effects of SPDC multi-pair events on entanglement visibility. A heralded single-pair entanglement source would support drastically higher pair generation rates.</p> <p>One open question is how to apply both the time-walk correction and the PNR attribution techniques simultaneously. This is important for in-development high-rate SNSPD arrays, successors to the PEACOQ <sup>9</sup>, which incorporate impedance matching tapers. These will support some degree of photon number resolution simply by spreading out the optical mode over multiple nanowires. But for excellent PNR, single-wire multi and single-photon event discrimination is necessary. For such arrays that must operate at very high rates for emerging quantum networking applications, single wires must support PNR attribution at high count rates as well.</p> <p>The development of a method for time-walk correction and simultaneous PNR attribution goes beyond the scope of this thesis. However, as discussed in chapter 4, we believe that high-dimensional modelling of the the SNDPD response is useful for overcoming this challenge. Both multi-photon and single-photon events will suffer from time-walk effects for SNSPD pulses that arrive soon after previous pulses. But graphing such data in a high dimensional space spanned by timing measurements from multiple trigger levels and the inter-pulse time \\(t'\\) may show seperated \\(|1\\rangle\\) and \\(|2+\\rangle\\) event groups. This is a promising direction for future research.</p> <p>SNSPD technology continues an ongoing trend of rapid improvement. This detector technology therefore is well positioned to dictate certain engineering features of emerging quantum communication and computing systems. Perhaps existing problems in quantum transduction and interconnects can be solved through the use of SNSPDs for high-rate high-efficiency bell state measurements.</p> <p>Certain types of quantum memories, for example, function best when interfaced with low-bandwidth, low-rate channels at wavelengths that are not well supported for long-haul transmission through fiber. This means there may be certain design choices for quantum repeaters and quantum computers that use bandwidth, and frequency conversion processes to interfaces high rate wide-bandwidth transmission channels with large banks of quantum memories. High rate SNSPDs could be pivotal in such conversion systems, and help bring about a robust system of interconnects between diverse quantum technologies.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Meyer-Scott, E., Silberhorn, C., &amp; Migdall, A.

It incorporates an innovative method for defining long running measurements based on a construct called <code>Actions</code>. <code>Actions</code> are objects that perform some operation at one stage in the script\u2019s main event loop (e.g., change an interferometer voltage to a specific value), or over multiple event loop iterations (e.g., integrate coincidences). Actions may also contain and run other actions, so that successively more complex measurements can be built from simple reusable components. This is done through an <code>evaluate</code> method that all <code>Action</code> methods share. The base class for all actions is located in <code>measurements/measurement</code>-<code>_management.py</code>.

But this approach quickly becomes untenable with many deeply nested if-statements and program state that is hard to reason about. Therefore, I developed a system of tasks or <code>Actions</code> that may be added to a task queue and 'consumed' by the main even loop. Each <code>Action</code> is an object that exposes an <code>.evaluate()</code> method that is called inside the program's main loop.

That means the time-domain spectrum produced at the detector by the dispersive element will have one or more photons in it, as shown in the figure with photons circled 1 and 2. Each of these corresponds to some frequency identifiable from their time delay induced by dispersion. Since the frequency multiplexing essentially forms many frequency bins, the mean photon number per bin is still very low despite the high pump power. Say the dispersion is such that idler photon 1 is higher frequency. If efficiency of SNSPD is high, it will detect the first photon that comes in, photon 1. The presence of photon 2 may make a weird shaped pulse because the two photons arrive within quick succession, faster than the relax time of the detector. But only the fast rising edge caused by the first photon matters. Because with that, the frequency of that first idler photon is determined and the frequency shifting ramped phase modulator can be adjusted accordingly to tailor the corresponding signal photon to the correct frequency. The other signal photon in the pulse will also be frequency shifted. But if following the phase modulator you have a narrowband filter centered around the frequency you are shifting all heralded single photons to, then the only photon that will go through is the signal of idler 1. The signal photon corresponding to idler 2 will be shifted out of band and be filtered out.</p> <p>So the TOF spectrometer has this PNR-like capability where it can ignore the presence of extra photons in the pulse once it gets information about a single idler that it can use.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_08/section_06_tof_spectrometer/#dispersion-bin-number-and-frequency-shifting-limits","title":"Dispersion, Bin Number, and Frequency Shifting Limits:","text":"<p>If one could achieve arbitrarily strong dispersion of the idler photons, then the natural choice would be to spread the SPDC pulse over several nanoseconds.

Fast pulses like this in conjunction with a dispersive medium would seem to work well with low jitter snspds in a TOF spectrometer. This is because the minimum width of discernible frequency bins in the resulting time domain spectrum is limited by the pump pulse width, as the effect of the dispersion is a convolution like smearing of the idler pulse. The lower the pulse width of the laser, the smaller the frequency bins may be and the more may be packed into a certain time window defined by the TDC hardware of the TOF spectrometer. Therefore, a shorter pump pulse width allows for more precise frequency measurement of heralded idler photons.</p> <p>However, the high precision of idler frequency discernable with this fast pump pulse may not actually be useful in a high rate single photon source for the following reason. The 2ps pump pulse, if produced by a near-transform limited mode locked laser, would have a bandwidth of about 1.4nm (185GHz). This means there is 185GHz of uncertainty in the frequency of the corresponding signal photon. The single photon source could use a bandpass filter with a comparable bandwidth on the output, but this may allow noise photons to make it out of the source also. The filter bandwidth could be decreased to constrain the single photon output more strongly, but this would clearly lower the overall generation rate.</p> <p>A much slower pump pulse width could be chosen also, but in this regime the width of time-domain frequency bins in the TOF spectrometer are limited by this pulsewidth. A low jitter snspd would not even be required in this case. However, for the slower pump pulse, the pump bandwidth is tighter, thereby better specifying the frequency of a signal photon given the frequency of the idler is well determined.</p> <p>It is instructive to understand both extremes, and how the engineering limitations of the SPDC crystal and ramped phase modulator work into these prely physics based limitations.</p>"},{"location":"chapter_08/section_07_sorption/","title":"Section 07 sorption","text":""},{"location":"chapter_08/section_07_sorption/#how-a-sorption-fridge-works","title":"How A Sorption Fridge Works","text":""},{"location":"chapter_09/","title":"Index","text":"<p>Note: the following section is primarily written by Samantha Davis, the second author of the paper High-rate multiplexed entanglement source based on time-bin qubits for advanced quantum networks.

These detectors usually operated just a few degrees above absolute zero. They are made from a current-biased and often meandered nanowire that partially transitions between a superconducting and resistive state when a photon is absorbed. This produces a voltage pulse, which is amplified and time-tagged, providing an accurate measurement of the photon arrival time.</p> <p>SNSPDs, first demonstrated in the 1990s~\\cite{Goltsman1996Picosecond}, are now mature devices used widely in fields from deep space optical communication, to biological imaging, to quantum communication and computation \\cite{natarajan2012superconducting, yamashita2017recent}. They are available commercially and are under continued development at national labs and universities. Much of the ongoing research into SNSPDs is centered around leveraging the device physics of the superconducting material to achieve higher performance across a number of metrics including efficiency, jitter, and count rate. However, getting the best performance out of both novel and more conventional SNSPD designs is not trivial. This thesis explores techniques for improving count rate, dark count rate, timing resolution, and photon number resolution of both emerging and more established types of SNSPDs. </p> <p>We first show a novel optical filtering technique can minimize the dark count rate of an SNSPD. Although geared towards applications that employ free space coupling, this work also demonstrates a dark count rate lower than the state of the art for fiber-coupled SNSPDs. </p> <p>We then study the dynamics that usually limit the maximum count rate of SNSPDs in application, namely the advent of bias-current reset and pileup-induced distortions that degrade timing resolution. Through a calibration and in-situ software correction procedure, we show that high count rate jitter can be reduced by a factor or 2 or more without the need for additional hardware or offline processing. This technique has wide applicability to many SNSPD systems that would benefit from the ability to run at higher count rates without sacrificing timing resolution.</p> <p>SNSPDs are used in the ground receiver for NASA's Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) project, which demonstrates high-rate optical communication with the Psyche spacecraft through a Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) scheme~\\cite{Srinivasan2023GroundReceiver}. We demonstrate SNSPD detection of a comparable PPM protocol operating 10 times faster than DSOC, and develop a novel method for resolving and correcting the presence of photon-number dependent effects in SNSPDs.</p> <p>In our final demonstration, we leverage the strengths of novel low-jitter SNSPDs~\\cite{Colangelo2023} in a high-rate entanglement distribution system based on a fast mode-locked laser. We show these detectors enable the use of highly stable and compact interferometers as well as readily available telecom multiplexing equipment. We demonstrate entanglement visibilities up to 99.4\\%, distillable entanglement rate of up to 3.55 MHz across 8 frequency channels, and predict a straightforward path towards achieving an order of magnitude improvement in rates without compromising visibility.</p> <p>This thesis works to uncover and demonstrate the best performance that can be obtained from both novel and more conventional SNSPDs. As we mainly study how to optimize the use and application of these devices \u2014 as opposed to the device physics or development of new SNSPDs \u2014 the content of this thesis has broad applicability to all users of this single photon detecting technology.</p>"},{"location":"frontmatter/acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>Here I feel a certain hesitancy towards expressing myself through text, as my feelings \u2014 towards all those who have helped bring me to this point \u2014 seem to defy projection down into the explicit nature of words on paper.

Comprising a current-biased nanowire transitioning between superconducting and resistive states upon photon absorption, SNSPDs generate voltage pulses for precise photon arrival time measurement. Initially demonstrated in the 1990s, SNSPDs are now mature devices widely employed in various fields, including space communication, biological imaging, and quantum technology. This thesis explores techniques to enhance usable count rate, dark count rate, timing resolution, and photon number resolution for both emerging and established SNSPD designs. We introduce a free space optical filtering method to minimize SNSPD dark count rates which is competitive with the state-of-the-art for fiber coupled SNSPDs, and especially impactful for space communication applications. We go on to study dynamics that limit SNSPD maximum count rates, presenting a calibration and in-situ correction procedure to significantly reduce jitter at high rates without additional hardware or offline processing. With an eye towards space communication applications beyond NASA's Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) project, we present a high-rate Pulse Position Modulation communication demo with SNSPDs. In the process we uncover a rich photon-number dependent response in these detectors and devise methods to properly leverage and manage it. Finally, we employ low-jitter SNSPDs in a high-rate entanglement distribution system, achieving high entanglement visibilities, and distillable entanglement rates.  As this work focuses on optimizing SNSPD usage and analysis rather than device physics or fabrication, it is broadly applicable to any users of this single photon detection technology.</p>"},{"location":"future_directions/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"future_directions/#future-directions","title":"Future directions","text":""},{"location":"future_directions/#distributed-data-acquisition-and-control-software-ddaq","title":"Distributed Data Acquisition and Control Software (DDAQ)","text":"<p>  Figure 1: DDAQ system architecture </p> <p>In order to do distributed quantum communication and network demonstrations, quantum nodes must be able to make accurate time-correlated measurements with respect to a shared clock and then communicate those measurements to other parties in the network.</p> <p>The process of sharing an accurate clock between locations is a challenge in itself. For the high rate entanglement project, an RF clock is currently used to synchronize one time tagger with the laser. However, we expect later versions of the system will be able to extract the clock directly from the quantum signals themselves using a phase-locked loop in software.</p> <p>If this works, then the challenge in demonstrating distributed entanglement revolves around sending information about the timing of photon detections over the internet and aligning them in time to determine what events correspond to coincidences and, therefore, valid qubits.</p> <p>The architecture of the DDAQ software handles this by defining \u2018worker\u2019 computers and \u2018time-tag server\u2019 computers that communicate with each other over TCP sockets. The time-tag servers assign each SNSPD measurement a \u2018clock index,\u2019 which is analogous to the number of clock cycles that have passed at the time of the measurement since the whole experiment or the time tagger was initialized. Two different time-tag servers will record the measurements of an entangled pair with two different clock indexes (as it\u2019s expected that the hardware of each time tagger was not initialized at exactly the same time). It is the job of \u2018worker\u2019 computers to compare the statistics received from time-tag servers to determine what offset relates the clock indexes of two time-tag servers. We expect the process of identifying the offset will involve a computation similar to that of a multi-start multi-stop histogram or correlation measurement.</p> <p>If the offset can be found, then the worker computer can correct for it and find events that match between the time-tag servers and identify the measurement of entangled photon pairs.</p> <p>The time for messages to travel from time-tag servers to worker computers varies depending on network state and congestion. Therefore, the worker computer must maintain a buffer of measurements collected over a period at least as long as the longest network-induced relative delays.
