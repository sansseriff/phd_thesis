Write a phd thesis acknowledgements section. Make it sound professional and eloquent. Use big words. 

Start the section with a paragraph similar to this, but a little more reserved and professional sounding:
"Of the many pages in this thesis, this small section is the most difficult to write. This difficulty does not come from thinking of who to acknowledge. Rather, it comes from the crushing fear of leaving someone out. The past six years have been some of the most satisfying of my life, both from an intellectual and emotional standpoint. "

Next, thank these people for the given reasons:

1. Boris Korzh - helpful, knowledgeable, acted as a true mentor during my early years, was always thinking of the next greatest challenge, 

2. Emma Wollman - very committed, knowledgeable, extremely dependable, always made my research a priority.

3. Eddy Ramirez - extremely humble, reminded me how lucky I am to be a part of this community, I had plenty of fun lunches with him

4. Sahil Patel - the best lab partner and friend anyone can hope for, We had many fun times together, talking about life and research. 

5. Samantha Davis - an incredibly knowledgeable lab mate and friend, I was always amazed by her skills with quantum mechanics and inspired by her scientific rigor. 

6. Jamie Luskin - She kept things real in the lab, when something needed to be said you could depend on Jamie to say it, kept our group hangouts spicy and interesting, great candor, very funny, always a source of lively conversation

7. Neil Sinclair – super friendly and down to earth, I learned so much about quantum optics from him, a dependable advisor. Not may people I’d be willing to spend on a night working on a teleportation experiment with, and he is one of them. 

8. Cristian Peña – for introducing me to the world of teleportation and quantum optics, I've always admired your devotion and incredible expertise in all things academia. 

9. Ioana Craiciu – always brightened my day, she has such passion for and interest in science, I loved discussing the true color of water and the peculiarities and data processing of human senses. 

10. Gregor Taylor – A true scottsman, an excellent climber and paper reviewer.

11. Maria Spiropulu – an daring and passionate mentor, the sheer force of her ability to get things done impresses me so much, 

12. Matt Shaw - extremely friendly boss, positive, honest, truly always wanted the best for his students, 

For the following people, just a few words of thanks and acknowledgment are needed. Group these into one paragraph. 

1.	Jason Trevor – great resource for anything related to lab logistics, anything mechanical
2.	Alex Walter – for schooling me in python
3.	Andrew Beyer – for making terrific wafers that enable all the work I’ve done here
4.	Hannah Rana – for being a voice of reason and experience at our lunches

Finish the section with a unique resonating quote or anecdote that expresses humility and thankfulness for having worked in this community. Here is an example, do not copy it. Come up with something new:
"Stephen Jay Gould, one of my scientific heroes, once wrote "I am, somehow,
less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in
the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton
fields and sweatshops." This is a quote that has stuck with me since I first
read it in middle school. The enormous privilege I have had throughout my
life is not lost on me. I write this paragraph as someone with a home with
fresh food and running water. As someone with loving family and friends. As
someone who is being paid to do what he loves. The physical, emotional, and
intellectual security I have been so lucky to have comes, at some level, at
the cost of others. This is a debt that can never be repaid, but I hope that
I can at least give to the future a fraction of what they gave to me."
