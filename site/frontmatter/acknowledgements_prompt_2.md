Write an ending section to a PhD acknowledgments section with a unique resonating quote or anecdote that expresses humility and thankfulness for having worked in this community. Here is an example, do not copy it. Come up with something new:
"Stephen Jay Gould, one of my scientific heroes, once wrote "I am, somehow,
less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einsteinâ€™s brain than in
the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton
fields and sweatshops." This is a quote that has stuck with me since I first
read it in middle school. The enormous privilege I have had throughout my
life is not lost on me. I write this paragraph as someone with a home with
fresh food and running water. As someone with loving family and friends. As
someone who is being paid to do what he loves. The physical, emotional, and
intellectual security I have been so lucky to have comes, at some level, at
the cost of others. This is a debt that can never be repaid, but I hope that
I can at least give to the future a fraction of what they gave to me."


Response: 

As I conclude this acknowledgments section, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities and support I have received throughout my research journey. I am humbled by the privilege I have had in being able to do what I love, and I am thankful for the amazing individuals who have helped me along the way.

As the physicist Richard Feynman once said, "The world is a wonderful place, and it is worth the trouble to understand it." I have been fortunate to have been a part of a community of individuals who share this passion for understanding the world, and I am grateful for the knowledge and insights I have gained through our collaborative efforts.

I would like to end with a quote from another one of my scientific heroes, Marie Curie: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less." This quote resonates with me because it reminds me of the importance of knowledge and understanding in overcoming the challenges we face in life. I am thankful to have had the opportunity to contribute to this pursuit of understanding, and I hope that my work can continue to help others fear less and live more fulfilling lives.

I am grateful for the privilege I have had and for the support I have received. I am humbled by the knowledge and expertise of those around me, and I am thankful for the opportunities I have had to learn and grow. I am excited for the future and the many possibilities it holds, and I am hopeful that I can continue to make a positive impact on the world through my work.
