## Abstract

Entanglement distribution based on time-bins is an attractive option for emerging quantum networks. We demonstrate a 4 GHz repetition rate source of photon pairs entangled across early and late time bins separated by 80 ps. Simultaneous high rates and high fidelities are achieved through multiplexing the Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) output into 8 energy-time entangled channel pairs. We demonstrate entanglement fidelities as high as 99.76%, total entanglement rates up to 0.5 Mbits/s, and predict a straightforward path towards achieving up to </span> [XXX]{.red markdown=""} Mbit/s. Finally, we resolve the density matrices of individual channels and express distillable entanglement rates in ebit/s, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between fidelity and coincidence rates that contributes to useful entanglement distribution. This source is a fundamental building block for high rate entanglement-based quantum key distribution systems or advanced quantum networks.
