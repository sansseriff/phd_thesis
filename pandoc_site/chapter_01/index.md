## Abstract

*A free-space coupled superconducting nanowire single photon detector with high efficiency at 1550 nm, sub-0.1 Hz dark count rate, and sub-15 ps timing jitter is demonstrated.*

#### Background

Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors are high sensitive devices. Any stray photons from a laboratory environment can make their way into these devices and produce a detection. These detections are commonly called dark counts or false counts. Dark counts can be present in any situation where the detector is coupled to some experiment or apparatus outside the cryogenic environment. This coupling may be through windows inside the cryostat housing and radiations shields, or through optical fibers that carry single-mode signals directly to detectors.

Visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photons are often the main sources of dark counts, because they are ubiquitous in a laboratory environment and are transmitted through common types of fibers and windows. Assuming visible light can be blocked from entering the detector system, the blackbody emission of the room temperature laboratory environment presents is the primary source of dark counts. The spectrum of blackbody photons, defined by Planckâ€™s law, is peaked at about $10~\mathrm{\upmu m}$, though it can contribute dark counts at significant rates up through near-infrared wavelengths.

Without filtering in fiber or free space, dark counts from blackbody emission will overload most SNSPDs and overpower the extremely faint signal of interest.
