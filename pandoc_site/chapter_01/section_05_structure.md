## Structure of this thesis

This thesis is organized into six main sections: an introduction, four chapters, and a conclusion. Each chapter is based on a major research project and includes an introduction, sections describing design choices and methods, and sections specifying results. Later sections in each chapter provide supplementary information and discussion. References to these supplementary discussions can be found throughout the respective chapters.

The first appendix includes exercises derived from Matthew Shawâ€™s 2022 series of guest lectures in the course titled Quantum Hardware and Techniques (Caltech APh/Ph 138b). Both problems delve into concepts closely related to, or motivating, research in this thesis. The first problem examines some subtle and non-intuitive features of effective free space coupling for a single photon detector through a cryostat window. The second problem shows how high-efficiency coupling to a photon number resolving detector is extremely important for heralded generation of non-classical light.

The second appendix includes summaries and links to the major software repositories created for the research in this thesis.
