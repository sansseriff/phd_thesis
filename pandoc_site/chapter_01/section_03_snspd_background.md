Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are prominent devices in the field of quantum optics and quantum information due to their extraordinary sensitivity, high detection efficiency, negligible dark counts, and ultimate time resolution. This chapter elaborates the fundamental principle behind the operation of an SNSPD, followed by the recent advancements and widely adopted applications in the field.

Operation Principles:

An SNSPD consists of a thin superconducting nanowire biased by a DC current. When the current flowing through the superconductor exceeds a certain critical value, the superconducting state is broken due to pair-breaking effect induced by a single photon. Upon absorption of a single photon, a localized region of the nanowire is excited and heats up above its superconducting transition temperature forming a normal-conducting 'hot-spot'.

The superconducting electron pairs undergo a mechanism called down-conversion cascade. Firstly, the photon absorbed by a superconducting electron breaks the Cooper pair producing a quasiparticle. This high-energy quasiparticle then scatters with its low-energy counterparts, thereby triggering a sequence of events, resulting in multiple low energy quasiparticle excitations.

As a result of this cascade, an area of the nanowire turns normal-conducting. This interruption to the superconductive state changes the impedance of the nanowire, leading to a transient voltage pulse which can be read out. Subsequently, the nanowire cools down through electron-phonon interaction and returns back to the superconducting state, making it ready for the next photon detection.

Typical Readout Circuit:

The readout scheme typically adopted for the detection of these electrical signals involves coupling the SNSPD to a high-speed amplifier such as a cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier, followed by a comparitor to convert the analogue signal to a TTL logic level signal. Bias-T circuitry is used to separate the DC biasing component and high-speed signals at the input.

Recent Advancements:

Recent advancements in the SNSPDs revolve around improving the detection efficiency, noise reduction, timing jitter, and expanding the waveband range. Processes such as nano-patterning techniques, and optimization of absorption efficiency and inductive coupling to the readout circuitry are a few methods contributing to the efficiency improvement. The use of new materials like tantalum nitride (Ta2N) and molybdenum silicide (MoSi) have demonstrated detectors with lower noise and expanded waveband capabilities.

Applications:

SNSPDs have been deployed in numerous applications across various fields. Quantum key distribution, laser ranging, optical time domain reflectometry, single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are some of the many applications where SNSPDs have demonstrated exceptional performance. With ongoing research, the reach of SNSPDs is expected to expand, eventually accommodating new applications.

In conclusion, SNSPDs, with their remarkable characteristics, have proven indispensable in the fields ranging from fundamental science to practical applications. The relentless research and technical advancements will drive their universal adoption and ensure they continue to play a pivotal role in the elucidation and exploitation of quantum phenomena.
