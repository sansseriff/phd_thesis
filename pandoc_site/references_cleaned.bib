The DCR of the SSPD, which is dominated by the blackbody radiation at room temperature, is blocked by introducing cold optical bandpass filter. We employ the differential phase shift QKD (DPS-QKD) scheme with a 1\&\#xA0;GHz system clock rate. The quantum bit error rate (QBER) below 3 percent  is achieved when the length of the dispersion shifted fiber (DSF) is 336\&\#xA0;km (72\&\#xA0;dB loss), which is low enough to generate secure keys.},

@article{Calandri2016,
abstract = {Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device. In a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20 percent  reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m-long narrowed regions used for sensing photons.},

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 \&\#x003BC;m in diameter, 70 \&\#x02013; 80\&\#x00025; efficiency at temperatures up to 4.2 K, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of \&\#x0223C; 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 \&\#x003BC;m diameter pixel. These performance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.},

abstract = {The rising demand for transmission capacity in optical networks has motivated steady interest in expansion beyond the standard C-band (1530--1565 nm) into the adjacent L-band (1565--1625 nm) for an approximate doubling of capacity in a single stroke. However, in the context of quantum networking, the L-band has yet to be fully leveraged with the suite of advanced tools for characterization and management available from classical lightwave communications. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrabroadband two-photon source integrating both C- and L-band wavelength-selective switches for complete control of spectral routing and allocation across 7.5 THz in a single setup. Polarization state tomography of all 150 pairs of 25-GHz-wide channels reveals an average fidelity of 0.98 and total distillable entanglement greater than 181 kebits/s. This source is explicitly designed for flex-grid optical networks and can facilitate optimal utilization of entanglement resources across the full C$+$L-band.},

Here, we present a continuously working, trusted-node free international link between Austria and Slovakia, directly distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs via 248{\thinspace}km of deployed telecommunication fiber. Despite 79{\thinspace}dB loss, we observe stable detected pair rates of 9{\thinspace}s−1 over 110{\thinspace}h. We mitigate multi-pair detections with strict temporal filtering, enabled by nonlocal compensation of chromatic dispersion and superconducting nanowire detectors. Fully automatized active polarization stabilization keeps the entangled state's visibility at 86 percent  for altogether 82{\thinspace}h. In a quantum cryptography context, this corresponds to an asymptotic secure key rate of 1.4 bits/s and 258 kbit of total key, considering finite-key effects. Our work paves the way for low-maintenance, ultra-stable quantum communication over long distances, independent of weather conditions and time of day, thus constituting an important step towards the quantum internet.},

abstract = {Entanglement is a universal resource in quantum networks, yet entangled photon sources are typically custom-made for a specific use case. Versatility, both in terms of state modulation and tunability of the temporal properties of the photons, is the key to flexible network architectures and cryptographic primitives that go beyond quantum key distribution. Here, we report on a flexible source design that produces high-quality entanglement in continuous-wave and GHz-rate-pulsed operation modes. Utilizing off-the-shelf optical components, our approach uses a fiber-based Sagnac loop to generate polarization-entangled photons at telecom wavelength with high efficiency and fidelities above 0.99. Phase modulation up to GHz before entangled state generation is also possible for fast entangled state switching. We show phase modulation at 100 MHz with an average fidelity of 0.95. Furthermore, the source 60 nm spectral bandwidth is entirely compatible with fully reconfigurable wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks.}

As a benchmark application we use quantum key distribution, and show low error and high secret key generation rates across several frequency channels, over both symmetric and asymmetric metropolitan-distance optical fibered links and including finite-size effects. By adapting the bandwidth allocation to specific network constraints, we also illustrate the flexible networking capability of our configuration. Together with the potential of our semiconductor source for distributing secret keys over a 60{\thinspace}nm bandwidth with commercial multiplexing technology, these results offer a promising route to the deployment of scalable quantum network architectures.},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of high-performance entangled photon-pairs in different degrees of freedom from a single piece of fiber pigtailed periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) waveguide. We utilize cascaded second-order nonlinear optical processes, i.e., second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), to generate photon-pairs. Previously, the performance of the photon-pairs is contaminated by Raman noise photons. Here by fiber-integrating the PPLN waveguide with noise-rejecting filters, we obtain a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) higher than 52,600 with photon-pair generation and detection rate of 52.36{\thinspace}kHz and 3.51{\thinspace}kHz, respectively. Energy-time, frequency-bin, and time-bin entanglement is prepared by coherently superposing correlated two-photon states in these degrees of freedom, respectively. The energy-time entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2.71{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.02 with two-photon interference visibility of 95.74{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.86 percent .

This result yields information–theoretic formulae for the distillable secret key, giving ‘ultimate’ key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specializing our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one–way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so–called ‘hashing inequality’, which says that the coherent information (i.e. the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen rate. This result is known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulae, which we briefly review. }

abstract = {Information encoded in high-dimensional quantum states can achieve ultrahigh rates over metropolitan distances. The security of conventional cryptography systems is threatened in the forthcoming era of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) features fundamentally proven security and offers a promising option for quantum-proof cryptography solution. Although prototype QKD systems over optical fiber have been demonstrated over the years, the key generation rates remain several orders of magnitude lower than current classical communication systems. In an effort toward a commercially viable QKD system with improved key generation rates, we developed a discrete-variable QKD system based on time-bin quantum photonic states that can generate provably secure cryptographic keys at megabit-per-second rates over metropolitan distances. We use high-dimensional quantum states that transmit more than one secret bit per received photon, alleviating detector saturation effects in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors used in our system that feature very high detection efficiency (of more than 70 percent ) and low timing jitter (of less than 40 ps). Our system is constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, and the adopted protocol can be readily extended to free-space quantum channels. The security analysis adopted to distill the keys ensures that the demonstrated protocol is robust against coherent attacks, finite-size effects, and a broad class of experimental imperfections identified in our system.}}

It has previously been shown to operate alongside classical communication in the same telecommunication fibre7--9 and over long distances in fibre10,11 and in free-space links12--15. Despite these advances, the practical applicability of quantum key distribution is curtailed by the fact that most implementations and protocols are limited to two communicating parties. Quantum networks scale the advantages of quantum key distribution protocols to more than two distant users. Here we present a fully connected quantum network architecture in which a single entangled photon source distributes quantum states to many users while minimizing the resources required for each. Further, it does so without sacrificing security or functionality relative to two-party communication schemes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bipartite polarization entanglement, which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels. Six states are then distributed between four users in a fully connected graph using only one fibre and one polarization analysis module per user. Because no adaptations of the entanglement source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of users, without requiring trust in the provider of the source. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active optical switches and therefore limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus has the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds.},

title = {Photon-efficient quantum key distribution using time–energy entanglement with high-dimensional encoding},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) typically uses binary encoding based on photon polarization or time-bin degrees of freedom and achieves a key capacity of at most one bit per photon. Under photon-starved conditions the rate of detection events is much lower than the photon generation rate, because of losses in long distance propagation and the relatively long recovery times of available single-photon detectors. Multi-bit encoding in the photon arrival times can be beneficial in such photon-starved situations. Recent security proofs indicate high-dimensional encoding in the photon arrival times is robust and can be implemented to yield high secure throughput. In this work we demonstrate entanglement-based QKD with high-dimensional encoding whose security against collective Gaussian attacks is provided by a high-visibility Franson interferometer. We achieve unprecedented key capacity and throughput for an entanglement-based QKD system because of four principal factors: Franson interferometry that does not degrade with loss; error correction coding that can tolerate high error rates; optimized time–energy entanglement generation; and highly efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. The secure key capacity yields as much as 8.7 bits per coincidence. When optimized for throughput we observe a secure key rate of 2.7 Mbit s−1 after 20 km fiber transmission with a key capacity of 6.9 bits per photon coincidence. Our results demonstrate a viable approach to high-rate QKD using practical photonic entanglement and single-photon detection technologies.}

abstract={Quantum key distribution has emerged as the most viable scheme to guarantee information security in the presence of large-scale quantum computers and, thanks to the continuous progress made in the past 20 years, it is now commercially available. However, the secret key rates remain limited to just over 10{\thinspace}Mbps due to several bottlenecks on the receiver side. Here we present a custom multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector that is designed to guarantee high count rates and precise timing discrimination. Leveraging the performance of the detector and coupling it to fast acquisition and real-time key distillation electronics, we remove two major roadblocks and achieve a considerable increase of the secret key rates with respect to the state of the art. In combination with a simple 2.5-GHz clocked time-bin quantum key distribution system, we can generate secret keys at a rate of 64{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 10.0{\thinspace}km and at a rate of 3.0{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 102.4{\thinspace}km with real-time key distillation.},

abstract = {Entangled photon-pair sources based on spontaneous parametric processes are widely used in photonic quantum information experiments. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between average photon-pair number and the visibility of two-photon interference (TPI) using those entanglement sources. We consider sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon pairs, assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors. We present formulas for the TPI visibility of a polarization entanglement that take account of all the high-order multi-pair emission events. Moreover, we show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small. As a result, we reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than a distinguishable one.}

abstract = "{Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector type for time correlated single photon counting, especially in the near-infrared. When operated at high count rates, SNSPDs exhibit increased timing jitter caused by internal device properties and features of the RF amplification chain. Variations in RF pulse height and shape lead to variations in the latency of timing measurements. To compensate for this, we demonstrate a calibration method that correlates delays in detection events with the time elapsed between pulses. The increase in jitter at high rates can be largely canceled in software by applying corrections derived from the calibration process. We demonstrate our method with a single-pixel tungsten silicide SNSPD and show it decreases high count rate jitter. The technique is especially effective at removing a long tail that appears in the instrument response function at high count rates. At a count rate of 11.4 MCounts/s, we reduce the full width at 1 percent  maximum level (FW1 percent M) by 45 percent . The method, therefore, enables certain quantum communication protocols that are rate-limited by the FW1 percent M metric to operate almost twice as fast.}",

In this work, we present a detector for single 1550\&\#x00A0;nm photons with up to 78 percent  detection efficiency, timing jitter below 50\&\#x00A0;ps FWHM, 158\&\#x00A0;counts/s dark count rate, as well as a maximum count rate of 1.5 giga-counts/s at 3\&\#x00A0;dB compression. The PEACOQ detector (Performance-Enhanced Array for Counting Optical Quanta) comprises a linear array of 32 straight superconducting niobium nitride nanowires that span the mode of an optical fiber. This design supports high count rates with minimal penalties for detection efficiency and timing jitter. We show how these trade-offs can be mitigated by implementing independent readout for each nanowire and by using a temporal walk correction technique to reduce count-rate dependent timing jitter. These detectors make quantum communication practical on a 10\&\#x00A0;GHz clock.},
