The DCR of the SSPD, which is dominated by the blackbody radiation at room temperature, is blocked by introducing cold optical bandpass filter. We employ the differential phase shift QKD (DPS-QKD) scheme with a 1\&\#xA0;GHz system clock rate. The quantum bit error rate (QBER) below 3 percent  is achieved when the length of the dispersion shifted fiber (DSF) is 336\&\#xA0;km (72\&\#xA0;dB loss), which is low enough to generate secure keys.},

@article{Calandri2016,
abstract = {Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device. In a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20 percent  reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m-long narrowed regions used for sensing photons.},

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 \&\#x003BC;m in diameter, 70 \&\#x02013; 80\&\#x00025; efficiency at temperatures up to 4.2 K, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of \&\#x0223C; 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 \&\#x003BC;m diameter pixel. These performance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.},

abstract = {The rising demand for transmission capacity in optical networks has motivated steady interest in expansion beyond the standard C-band (1530--1565 nm) into the adjacent L-band (1565--1625 nm) for an approximate doubling of capacity in a single stroke. However, in the context of quantum networking, the L-band has yet to be fully leveraged with the suite of advanced tools for characterization and management available from classical lightwave communications. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrabroadband two-photon source integrating both C- and L-band wavelength-selective switches for complete control of spectral routing and allocation across 7.5 THz in a single setup. Polarization state tomography of all 150 pairs of 25-GHz-wide channels reveals an average fidelity of 0.98 and total distillable entanglement greater than 181 kebits/s. This source is explicitly designed for flex-grid optical networks and can facilitate optimal utilization of entanglement resources across the full C$+$L-band.},

abstract={Reliable long-distance distribution of entanglement is a key technique for many quantum applications, most notably quantum key distribution. Here, we present a continuously working, trusted-node free international link between Austria and Slovakia, directly distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs via 248{\thinspace}km of deployed telecommunication fiber. Despite 79{\thinspace}dB loss, we observe stable detected pair rates of 9{\thinspace}s−1 over 110{\thinspace}h. We mitigate multi-pair detections with strict temporal filtering, enabled by nonlocal compensation of chromatic dispersion and superconducting nanowire detectors. Fully automatized active polarization stabilization keeps the entangled state's visibility at 86 percent  for altogether 82{\thinspace}h. In a quantum cryptography context, this corresponds to an asymptotic secure key rate of 1.4 bits/s and 258 kbit of total key, considering finite-key effects. Our work paves the way for low-maintenance, ultra-stable quantum communication over long distances, independent of weather conditions and time of day, thus constituting an important step towards the quantum internet.},

abstract = {Entanglement is a universal resource in quantum networks, yet entangled photon sources are typically custom-made for a specific use case. Versatility, both in terms of state modulation and tunability of the temporal properties of the photons, is the key to flexible network architectures and cryptographic primitives that go beyond quantum key distribution. Here, we report on a flexible source design that produces high-quality entanglement in continuous-wave and GHz-rate-pulsed operation modes. Utilizing off-the-shelf optical components, our approach uses a fiber-based Sagnac loop to generate polarization-entangled photons at telecom wavelength with high efficiency and fidelities above 0.99. Phase modulation up to GHz before entangled state generation is also possible for fast entangled state switching. We show phase modulation at 100 MHz with an average fidelity of 0.95. Furthermore, the source 60 nm spectral bandwidth is entirely compatible with fully reconfigurable wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks.}

We propose and demonstrate a quantum local area network design that addresses current deployment limitations in timing and security in a scalable fashion using commercial off-the-shelf components. First, we employ White Rabbit switches to synchronize three remote nodes with ultra-low timing jitter, significantly increasing the fidelities of the distributed entangled states over previous work with Global Positioning System clocks. Second, using a parallel quantum key distribution channel, we secure the classical communications needed for instrument control and data management. In this way, the conventional network that manages our entanglement network is secured using keys generated via an underlying quantum key distribution layer, preserving the integrity of the supporting systems and the relevant data in a future-proof fashion.},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of high-performance entangled photon-pairs in different degrees of freedom from a single piece of fiber pigtailed periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) waveguide. We utilize cascaded second-order nonlinear optical processes, i.e., second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), to generate photon-pairs. Previously, the performance of the photon-pairs is contaminated by Raman noise photons. Here by fiber-integrating the PPLN waveguide with noise-rejecting filters, we obtain a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) higher than 52,600 with photon-pair generation and detection rate of 52.36{\thinspace}kHz and 3.51{\thinspace}kHz, respectively. Energy-time, frequency-bin, and time-bin entanglement is prepared by coherently superposing correlated two-photon states in these degrees of freedom, respectively. The energy-time entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2.71{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.02 with two-photon interference visibility of 95.74{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.86 percent .

This result yields information–theoretic formulae for the distillable secret key, giving ‘ultimate’ key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specializing our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one–way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so–called ‘hashing inequality’, which says that the coherent information (i.e. the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen rate. This result is known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulae, which we briefly review. }

abstract = {Information encoded in high-dimensional quantum states can achieve ultrahigh rates over metropolitan distances. The security of conventional cryptography systems is threatened in the forthcoming era of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) features fundamentally proven security and offers a promising option for quantum-proof cryptography solution. Although prototype QKD systems over optical fiber have been demonstrated over the years, the key generation rates remain several orders of magnitude lower than current classical communication systems. In an effort toward a commercially viable QKD system with improved key generation rates, we developed a discrete-variable QKD system based on time-bin quantum photonic states that can generate provably secure cryptographic keys at megabit-per-second rates over metropolitan distances. We use high-dimensional quantum states that transmit more than one secret bit per received photon, alleviating detector saturation effects in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors used in our system that feature very high detection efficiency (of more than 70 percent ) and low timing jitter (of less than 40 ps). Our system is constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, and the adopted protocol can be readily extended to free-space quantum channels. The security analysis adopted to distill the keys ensures that the demonstrated protocol is robust against coherent attacks, finite-size effects, and a broad class of experimental imperfections identified in our system.}}

It has previously been shown to operate alongside classical communication in the same telecommunication fibre7--9 and over long distances in fibre10,11 and in free-space links12--15. Despite these advances, the practical applicability of quantum key distribution is curtailed by the fact that most implementations and protocols are limited to two communicating parties. Quantum networks scale the advantages of quantum key distribution protocols to more than two distant users. Here we present a fully connected quantum network architecture in which a single entangled photon source distributes quantum states to many users while minimizing the resources required for each. Further, it does so without sacrificing security or functionality relative to two-party communication schemes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bipartite polarization entanglement, which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels. Six states are then distributed between four users in a fully connected graph using only one fibre and one polarization analysis module per user. Because no adaptations of the entanglement source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of users, without requiring trust in the provider of the source. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active optical switches and therefore limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus has the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) typically uses binary encoding based on photon polarization or time-bin degrees of freedom and achieves a key capacity of at most one bit per photon. Under photon-starved conditions the rate of detection events is much lower than the photon generation rate, because of losses in long distance propagation and the relatively long recovery times of available single-photon detectors. Multi-bit encoding in the photon arrival times can be beneficial in such photon-starved situations. Recent security proofs indicate high-dimensional encoding in the photon arrival times is robust and can be implemented to yield high secure throughput. In this work we demonstrate entanglement-based QKD with high-dimensional encoding whose security against collective Gaussian attacks is provided by a high-visibility Franson interferometer. We achieve unprecedented key capacity and throughput for an entanglement-based QKD system because of four principal factors: Franson interferometry that does not degrade with loss; error correction coding that can tolerate high error rates; optimized time–energy entanglement generation; and highly efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. The secure key capacity yields as much as 8.7 bits per coincidence. When optimized for throughput we observe a secure key rate of 2.7 Mbit s−1 after 20 km fiber transmission with a key capacity of 6.9 bits per photon coincidence. Our results demonstrate a viable approach to high-rate QKD using practical photonic entanglement and single-photon detection technologies.}

abstract={Quantum key distribution has emerged as the most viable scheme to guarantee information security in the presence of large-scale quantum computers and, thanks to the continuous progress made in the past 20 years, it is now commercially available. However, the secret key rates remain limited to just over 10{\thinspace}Mbps due to several bottlenecks on the receiver side. Here we present a custom multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector that is designed to guarantee high count rates and precise timing discrimination. Leveraging the performance of the detector and coupling it to fast acquisition and real-time key distillation electronics, we remove two major roadblocks and achieve a considerable increase of the secret key rates with respect to the state of the art. In combination with a simple 2.5-GHz clocked time-bin quantum key distribution system, we can generate secret keys at a rate of 64{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 10.0{\thinspace}km and at a rate of 3.0{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 102.4{\thinspace}km with real-time key distillation.},

abstract = {Entangled photon-pair sources based on spontaneous parametric processes are widely used in photonic quantum information experiments. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between average photon-pair number and the visibility of two-photon interference (TPI) using those entanglement sources. We consider sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon pairs, assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors. We present formulas for the TPI visibility of a polarization entanglement that take account of all the high-order multi-pair emission events. Moreover, we show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small. As a result, we reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than a distinguishable one.}

abstract = "{Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector type for time correlated single photon counting, especially in the near-infrared. When operated at high count rates, SNSPDs exhibit increased timing jitter caused by internal device properties and features of the RF amplification chain. Variations in RF pulse height and shape lead to variations in the latency of timing measurements. To compensate for this, we demonstrate a calibration method that correlates delays in detection events with the time elapsed between pulses. The increase in jitter at high rates can be largely canceled in software by applying corrections derived from the calibration process. We demonstrate our method with a single-pixel tungsten silicide SNSPD and show it decreases high count rate jitter. The technique is especially effective at removing a long tail that appears in the instrument response function at high count rates. At a count rate of 11.4 MCounts/s, we reduce the full width at 1 percent  maximum level (FW1 percent M) by 45 percent . The method, therefore, enables certain quantum communication protocols that are rate-limited by the FW1 percent M metric to operate almost twice as fast.}",

TCSPC has developed from an intrinsically time-consuming and one-dimensional technique into a fast, multi-dimensional technique to record light signals. So this reference and text describes how advanced TCSPC techniques work and demonstrates their application to time-resolved laser scanning microscopy, single molecule spectroscopy, photon correlation experiments, and diffuse optical tomography of biological tissue. It gives practical hints about constructing suitable optical systems, choosing and using detectors, detector safety, preamplifiers, and using the control features and optimising the operating conditions of TCSPC devices. Advanced TCSPC Techniques is an indispensable tool for everyone in research and development who is confronted with the task of recording low-intensity light signals in the picosecond and nanosecond range. "The monograph by Dr Wolfgang Becker is a complete and lucid summary of both the basic principles and the state-of-the-art of TCSPC. This book contains descriptions that are only available from the primary literature or specialized web sites. An understanding of the present technology will allow the reader to make effective use of the multi-dimensional capabilities of modern time-resolved fluorescence instruments." Joseph R.

Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a rapidly growing optical technology able to non-invasively assess the blood flow index (BFi) at the bedside. The current limitations of DCS are the contamination introduced by extracerebral tissue and the need to know the tissue\&\#x2019;s optical properties to correctly quantify the BFi. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new technology for time-resolved diffuse correlation spectroscopy. By operating DCS in the time domain (TD-DCS), we are able to simultaneously acquire the temporal point-spread function to quantify tissue optical properties and the autocorrelation function to quantify the BFi. More importantly, by applying time-gated strategies to the DCS autocorrelation functions, we are able to differentiate between short and long photon paths through the tissue and determine the BFi for different depths. Here, we present the novel device and we report the first experiments in tissue-like phantoms and in rodents. The TD-DCS method opens many possibilities for improved non-invasive monitoring of oxygen delivery in humans.},

A host of architectures have been investigated, ranging from simpler implementations, based solely on off-chip data processing, to progressively ``smarter'' sensors including on-chip, or even pixel level, time-stamping and processing capabilities. As the technology has matured, a range of biophotonics applications have been explored, including (endoscopic) FLIM, (multibeam multiphoton) FLIM-FRET, SPIM-FCS, super-resolution microscopy, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, NIROT and PET.

Several algorithms have been developed for recovering the true pulse information using the available digital processing platforms. In this study, four well-established pile-up correction methods are numerically compared: single event reconstruction, template matching, maximum likelihood estimation and high-yield pile-up event recovery. Different pile-up waveforms are simulated by using the extracted parameters from the experimental data of a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The experimental pulses are taken from the charge sensitive preamplifier output, and therefore the methods are compared on the timescale of the RC constant of the preamplifier. Under such circumstance, the methods are compared with respect to their sensitivity to noise, variation of pulse shape, sampling rate and probable errors in time pick-off. In addition, their performance is assessed by calculating the experimental energy spectra of 137Cs at different high-count-rates. The results of the present study provide the benefits and limitations of each method, which can be used to select the best pile-up correction strategy for each specific application.}

              performing complex discrete signal processing algorithms with
              clock rates above 100MHz. This combined with FPGA's low expense,
              ease of use, and selected dedicated hardware make them an ideal
              technology for a data acquisition system for a positron emission
              tomography (PET) scanner. The University of Washington is
              producing a high-resolution, small-animal PET scanner that
              utilizes FPGAs as the core of the front-end electronics. For this
              next generation scanner, functions that are typically performed
              in dedicated circuits, or offline, are being migrated to the
              FPGA. This will not only simplify the electronics, but the
              features of modern FPGAs can be utilizes to add significant
              signal processing power to produce higher resolution images. In
              this paper we report on an all-digital pulse pileup correction
              algorithm that is being developed for the FPGA. The pileup
              mitigation algorithm will allow the scanner to run at higher
              count rates without incurring large data losses due to the
              overlapping of scintillation signals. This correction technique
              utilizes a reference pulse to extract timing and energy
              information for most pileup events. Using pulses were acquired
              from a Zecotech Photonics MAPDN with an LFS-3 scintillator, we
              show that good timing and energy information can be achieved in

This is a monolithic doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator (OPO) far below threshold, which generates photon pairs by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) at around 1560 nm with a 117 MHz (0.91 pm)-bandwidth. A coherence time of 2.7 ns is estimated by a time correlation measurement and a high quality of the entangled states is confirmed by a Bell-type experiment. Since highly coherent energy–time-entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime are suitable for long distance transmission and manipulation, this source is well suited to the requirements of quantum communication.}

However, in the context of quantum networking, the L-band has yet to be fully leveraged with the suite of advanced tools for characterization and management available from classical lightwave communications. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrabroadband two-photon source integrating both C- and L-band wavelength-selective switches for complete control of spectral routing and allocation across 7.5 THz in a single setup. Polarization state tomography of all 150 pairs of 25-GHz-wide channels reveals an average fidelity of 0.98 and total distillable entanglement greater than 181 kebits/s. This source is explicitly designed for flex-grid optical networks and can facilitate optimal utilization of entanglement resources across the full C$+$L-band.},

abstract = {Entanglement is a universal resource in quantum networks, yet entangled photon sources are typically custom-made for a specific use case. Versatility, both in terms of state modulation and tunability of the temporal properties of the photons, is the key to flexible network architectures and cryptographic primitives that go beyond quantum key distribution. Here, we report on a flexible source design that produces high-quality entanglement in continuous-wave and GHz-rate-pulsed operation modes. Utilizing off-the-shelf optical components, our approach uses a fiber-based Sagnac loop to generate polarization-entangled photons at telecom wavelength with high efficiency and fidelities above 0.99. Phase modulation up to GHz before entangled state generation is also possible for fast entangled state switching. We show phase modulation at 100 MHz with an average fidelity of 0.95. Furthermore, the source 60 nm spectral bandwidth is entirely compatible with fully reconfigurable wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks.}

abstract={Quantum communication networks enable applications ranging from highly secure communication to clock synchronization and distributed quantum computing. Miniaturized, flexible, and cost-efficient resources will be key elements for ensuring the scalability of such networks as they progress towards large-scale deployed infrastructures. Here, we bring these elements together by combining an on-chip, telecom-wavelength, broadband entangled photon source with industry-grade flexible-grid wavelength division multiplexing techniques, to demonstrate reconfigurable entanglement distribution between up to 8 users in a resource-optimized quantum network topology. As a benchmark application we use quantum key distribution, and show low error and high secret key generation rates across several frequency channels, over both symmetric and asymmetric metropolitan-distance optical fibered links and including finite-size effects. By adapting the bandwidth allocation to specific network constraints, we also illustrate the flexible networking capability of our configuration. Together with the potential of our semiconductor source for distributing secret keys over a 60{\thinspace}nm bandwidth with commercial multiplexing technology, these results offer a promising route to the deployment of scalable quantum network architectures.},

We propose and demonstrate a quantum local area network design that addresses current deployment limitations in timing and security in a scalable fashion using commercial off-the-shelf components. First, we employ White Rabbit switches to synchronize three remote nodes with ultra-low timing jitter, significantly increasing the fidelities of the distributed entangled states over previous work with Global Positioning System clocks. Second, using a parallel quantum key distribution channel, we secure the classical communications needed for instrument control and data management. In this way, the conventional network that manages our entanglement network is secured using keys generated via an underlying quantum key distribution layer, preserving the integrity of the supporting systems and the relevant data in a future-proof fashion.},

pages={123},
abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate the generation of high-performance entangled photon-pairs in different degrees of freedom from a single piece of fiber pigtailed periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) waveguide. We utilize cascaded second-order nonlinear optical processes, i.e., second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), to generate photon-pairs. Previously, the performance of the photon-pairs is contaminated by Raman noise photons. Here by fiber-integrating the PPLN waveguide with noise-rejecting filters, we obtain a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) higher than 52,600 with photon-pair generation and detection rate of 52.36{\thinspace}kHz and 3.51{\thinspace}kHz, respectively. Energy-time, frequency-bin, and time-bin entanglement is prepared by coherently superposing correlated two-photon states in these degrees of freedom, respectively. The energy-time entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2.71{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.02 with two-photon interference visibility of 95.74{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.86 percent . The frequency-bin entangled two-photon states achieve fidelity of 97.56{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}1.79 percent  with a spatial quantum beating visibility of 96.85{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}2.46 percent . The time-bin entangled two-photon states achieve the maximum value of CHSH-Bell inequality of S{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2.60{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.04 and quantum tomographic fidelity of 89.07{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}4.35 percent .

    abstract = { We study and solve the problem of distilling a secret key from quantum states representing correlation between two parties (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) via one–way public discussion: we prove a coding theorem to achieve the ‘wire–tapper’ bound, the difference of the mutual information Alice–Bob and that of Alice–Eve, for so–called classical–quantum–quantum–correlations, via one–way public communication. This result yields information–theoretic formulae for the distillable secret key, giving ‘ultimate’ key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specializing our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one–way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so–called ‘hashing inequality’, which says that the coherent information (i.e. the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen rate. This result is known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulae, which we briefly review. }

Utilizing a novel analyzer apparatus, we observe stable quantum bit error ratios of 5.32\&\#x2009;\&\#x0025;, suitable for generating secure keys, despite significant wavefront distortions and polarization fluctuations across a 1.2\&\#x2009;km channel.

abstract = {Information encoded in high-dimensional quantum states can achieve ultrahigh rates over metropolitan distances. The security of conventional cryptography systems is threatened in the forthcoming era of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) features fundamentally proven security and offers a promising option for quantum-proof cryptography solution. Although prototype QKD systems over optical fiber have been demonstrated over the years, the key generation rates remain several orders of magnitude lower than current classical communication systems. In an effort toward a commercially viable QKD system with improved key generation rates, we developed a discrete-variable QKD system based on time-bin quantum photonic states that can generate provably secure cryptographic keys at megabit-per-second rates over metropolitan distances. We use high-dimensional quantum states that transmit more than one secret bit per received photon, alleviating detector saturation effects in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors used in our system that feature very high detection efficiency (of more than 70 percent ) and low timing jitter (of less than 40 ps). Our system is constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, and the adopted protocol can be readily extended to free-space quantum channels. The security analysis adopted to distill the keys ensures that the demonstrated protocol is robust against coherent attacks, finite-size effects, and a broad class of experimental imperfections identified in our system.}}

Quantum networks scale the advantages of quantum key distribution protocols to more than two distant users. Here we present a fully connected quantum network architecture in which a single entangled photon source distributes quantum states to many users while minimizing the resources required for each. Further, it does so without sacrificing security or functionality relative to two-party communication schemes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bipartite polarization entanglement, which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels. Six states are then distributed between four users in a fully connected graph using only one fibre and one polarization analysis module per user. Because no adaptations of the entanglement source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of users, without requiring trust in the provider of the source. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active optical switches and therefore limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus has the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds.},

title = {Photon-efficient quantum key distribution using time–energy entanglement with high-dimensional encoding},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) typically uses binary encoding based on photon polarization or time-bin degrees of freedom and achieves a key capacity of at most one bit per photon. Under photon-starved conditions the rate of detection events is much lower than the photon generation rate, because of losses in long distance propagation and the relatively long recovery times of available single-photon detectors. Multi-bit encoding in the photon arrival times can be beneficial in such photon-starved situations. Recent security proofs indicate high-dimensional encoding in the photon arrival times is robust and can be implemented to yield high secure throughput. In this work we demonstrate entanglement-based QKD with high-dimensional encoding whose security against collective Gaussian attacks is provided by a high-visibility Franson interferometer. We achieve unprecedented key capacity and throughput for an entanglement-based QKD system because of four principal factors: Franson interferometry that does not degrade with loss; error correction coding that can tolerate high error rates; optimized time–energy entanglement generation; and highly efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. The secure key capacity yields as much as 8.7 bits per coincidence. When optimized for throughput we observe a secure key rate of 2.7 Mbit s−1 after 20 km fiber transmission with a key capacity of 6.9 bits per photon coincidence. Our results demonstrate a viable approach to high-rate QKD using practical photonic entanglement and single-photon detection technologies.}

Here we present a custom multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector that is designed to guarantee high count rates and precise timing discrimination. Leveraging the performance of the detector and coupling it to fast acquisition and real-time key distillation electronics, we remove two major roadblocks and achieve a considerable increase of the secret key rates with respect to the state of the art. In combination with a simple 2.5-GHz clocked time-bin quantum key distribution system, we can generate secret keys at a rate of 64{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 10.0{\thinspace}km and at a rate of 3.0{\thinspace}Mbps over a distance of 102.4{\thinspace}km with real-time key distillation.},

In this paper, we clarify the relationship between average photon-pair number and the visibility of two-photon interference (TPI) using those entanglement sources. We consider sources that generate distinguishable and indistinguishable entangled photon pairs, assuming coincidence measurements that use threshold detectors. We present formulas for the TPI visibility of a polarization entanglement that take account of all the high-order multi-pair emission events. Moreover, we show that the formulas can be approximated with simple functions of the average pair number when the photon collection efficiency is small. As a result, we reveal that an indistinguishable entangled pair provides better visibility than a distinguishable one.}

abstract = "{Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector type for time correlated single photon counting, especially in the near-infrared. When operated at high count rates, SNSPDs exhibit increased timing jitter caused by internal device properties and features of the RF amplification chain. Variations in RF pulse height and shape lead to variations in the latency of timing measurements. To compensate for this, we demonstrate a calibration method that correlates delays in detection events with the time elapsed between pulses. The increase in jitter at high rates can be largely canceled in software by applying corrections derived from the calibration process. We demonstrate our method with a single-pixel tungsten silicide SNSPD and show it decreases high count rate jitter. The technique is especially effective at removing a long tail that appears in the instrument response function at high count rates. At a count rate of 11.4 MCounts/s, we reduce the full width at 1 percent  maximum level (FW1 percent M) by 45 percent . The method, therefore, enables certain quantum communication protocols that are rate-limited by the FW1 percent M metric to operate almost twice as fast.}",

abstract = {Abstract Granting information privacy is of crucial importance in our society, notably in fiber communication networks. Quantum cryptography provides a unique means to establish, at remote locations, identical strings of genuine random bits, with a level of secrecy unattainable using classical resources. However, several constraints, such as non-optimized photon number statistics and resources, detectors' noise, and optical losses, currently limit the performances in terms of both achievable secret key rates and distances. Here, these issues are addressed using an approach that combines both fundamental and off-the-shelves technological resources. High-quality bipartite photonic entanglement is distributed over a 150 km fiber link, exploiting a wavelength demultiplexing strategy implemented at the end-user locations. It is shown how coincidence rates scale linearly with the number of employed telecommunication channels, with values outperforming previous realizations by almost one order of magnitude. Thanks to its potential of scalability and compliance with device-independent strategies, this system is ready for real quantum applications, notably entanglement-based quantum cryptography.},

abstract={For the past 50{\thinspace}years, superconducting detectors have offered exceptional sensitivity and speed for detecting faint electromagnetic signals in a wide range of applications. These detectors operate at very low temperatures and generate a minimum of excess noise, making them ideal for testing the non-local nature of reality1,2, investigating dark matter3,4, mapping the early universe5--7 and performing quantum computation8--10 and communication11--14. Despite their appealing properties, however, there are at present no large-scale superconducting cameras---even the largest demonstrations have never exceeded 20,000{\thinspace}pixels15. This is especially true for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs)16--18. These detectors have been demonstrated with system detection efficiencies of 98.0 percent  (ref.{\thinspace}19), sub-3-ps timing jitter20, sensitivity from the ultraviolet21 to the mid-infrared22 and microhertz dark-count rates3, but have never achieved an array size larger than a kilopixel23,24. Here we report on the development of a 400,000-pixel SNSPD camera, a factor of 400 improvement over the state of the art. The array spanned an area of 4{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}2.5{\thinspace}mm with 5{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}5-$\mu$m resolution, reached unity quantum efficiency at wavelengths of 370{\thinspace}nm and 635{\thinspace}nm, counted at a rate of 1.1{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}105{\thinspace}counts per second (cps) and had a dark-count rate of 1.0{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−4{\thinspace}cps per detector (corresponding to 0.13{\thinspace}cps over the whole array). The imaging area contains no ancillary circuitry and the architecture is scalable well beyond the present demonstration, paving the way for large-format superconducting cameras with near-unity detection efficiencies across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum.},

abstract = {The single-photon detector is an essential technology in photonic quantum information science and technology. Large-scale photonic quantum computers and quantum networks inevitably require numerous high-performance single-photon detectors. Superconducting nanostrip single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) using around 100-nm-wide nanostrips are promising technologies with high detection efficiency, low dark count, and low jitter, but there has been room for evolution in terms of polarization dependence and productivity. Using wide strips with widths of tens of micrometers provides polarization-independent high detection efficiency and high-yield fabrication using high-throughput photolithography with submicron resolution. However, detecting photons with such wide strips has been challenging due to rapidly increasing intrinsic dark counts caused by the uneven distribution of the superconducting current in the strip. Here, we present a novel superconducting wide strip photon detector (SWSPD) with a high critical current bank (HCCB) structure. This new strip structure suppresses the intrinsic dark counts and provides highly efficient photon detection in the wide strips. We have simultaneously achieved a polarization-independent detection efficiency of over 78\&\#x0025; for 1550-nm wavelength photons, a low dark count rate (DCR) of \&\#x223C;80\&\#x2005;cps, and a low jitter of 29.8\&\#x2005;ps using a 20-\&\#x00B5;m-wide SWSPD with the HCCB structure. This result paves the way for a new class of photon detectors using ultra-wide superconducting strips. These photon detectors with excellent productivity and polarization-independent high detection performances would boost the advance of large-scale photonic quantum technologies.},

The DCR is limited by the blackbody radiation through a signal passband of 20-nm bandwidth. The figure of merit, system detection efficiency, and DCR were 2.7{\texttimes}1011, 2.3 percent , and 10{\textminus}3  Hz, respectively. Narrowing the bandwidth to 100 GHz suppresses the DCR to 10{\textminus}4  Hz, and the figure of merit increases to 1.8{\texttimes}1012.},

@article{Calandri2016,
abstract = {Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device. In a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20 percent  reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m-long narrowed regions used for sensing photons.},

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 \&\#x003BC;m in diameter, 70 \&\#x02013; 80\&\#x00025; efficiency at temperatures up to 4.2 K, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of \&\#x0223C; 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 \&\#x003BC;m diameter pixel. These performance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.},

abstract = {Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are an enabling technology for myriad quantum-optics experiments that require high-efficiency detection, large count rates, and precise timing resolution. The system detection efficiencies (SDEs) for fiber-coupled SNSPDs have fallen short of theoretical predictions of near unity by at least 7 percent , with the discrepancy being attributed to scattering, material absorption, and other SNSPD dynamics. We optimize the design and fabrication of an all-dielectric layered stack and fiber coupling package in order to achieve 98.0{\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}0.5 percent  SDE, measured for single-mode-fiber guided photons derived from a highly attenuated 1550 nm continuous-wave laser. This enforces a smaller bound on the scattering and absorption losses in such systems and opens the use of SNSPDs for scenarios that demand high-SDE for throughput and fidelity.},

abstract = {The quality of an image is limited to the signal-to-noise ratio of the output from sensors. As the background noise increases much more than the signal, which can be caused by either a huge attenuation of light pulses after a long-haul transmission or a blinding attack with a strong flood illumination, an imaging system stops working properly. Here we built a superconducting single-photon infrared camera of negligible dark counts and 60 ps timing resolution. Combining with an adaptive 3D slicing algorithm that gives each pixel an optimal temporal window to distinguish clustered signal photons from a uniformly distributed background, we successfully reconstructed 3D single-photon images at both a low signal level ($\sim$1 average photon per pixel) and extremely high noise background (background-to-signal ratio $=$ 200 within a period of 50 ns before denoising). Among all detection events, we were able to remove 99.45 percent  of the noise photons while keeping the signal photon loss at 0.74 percent . This Letter is a direct outcome of quantum-inspired imaging that asks for a co-development of sensors and computational methods. We envision that the proposed methods can increase the working distance of a long-haul imaging system or defend it from blinding attacks.},

@article{Curty2014,
abstract = {Quantum key distribution promises unconditionally secure communications. However, as practical devices tend to deviate from their specifications, the security of some practical systems is no longer valid. In particular, an adversary can exploit imperfect detectors to learn a large part of the secret key, even though the security proof claims otherwise. Recently, a practical approach-measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution-has been proposed to solve this problem. However, so far its security has only been fully proven under the assumption that the legitimate users of the system have unlimited resources. Here we fill this gap and provide a rigorous security proof against general attacks in the finite-key regime. This is obtained by applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound, to perform parameter estimation. For the first time we demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance implementations of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution within a reasonable time frame of signal transmission.},

Our single-photon detectors are superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a collection area only a factor of a few larger than the area of the fiber core which presents significant challenges to low-loss fiber-to-detector coupling. The coupling method presented here has low loss, cryogenic compatibility, easy and reproducible assembly and low component cost. The system efficiency of the packaged single-photon counting detectors is verified by the ``triplet method'' of power-source calibration along with the ``multiple attenuator'' method that produces a calibrated single-photon flux. These calibration techniques, when used in combination with through-wafer imaging and fiber back-reflection measurements, give us confidence that we have achieved coupling losses below 1  percent  for all devices packaged according to the self-alignment method presented in this paper.},

A key benchmark for this is to demonstrate their performance in complex quantum networking protocols, such as entanglement swapping between truly independent photon-pair sources. Here, using two independent, asynchronously-pumped, integrated Si3N4 microring resonator photon-pair sources, operating in the CW regime with time-resolved detections, we obtained state of the art HOM (93.2 ± 1.6 percent) and entanglement swapping (91.2 ± 3.4 percent) visibilities, while maintaining high rates. The time-resolved detection facilitates high spectral purities without the need for spectral filtering. Our results demonstrate the potential of such telecom-band sources for practical, real-world quantum communication.}

@article{Chen2021,
abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD)1,2 has the potential to enable secure communication and information transfer3. In the laboratory, the feasibility of point-to-point QKD is evident from the early proof-of-concept demonstration in the laboratory over 32 centimetres4; this distance was later extended to the 100-kilometre scale5,6 with decoy-state QKD and more recently to the 500-kilometre scale7–10 with measurement-device-independent QKD. Several small-scale QKD networks have also been tested outside the laboratory11–14. However, a global QKD network requires a practically (not just theoretically) secure and reliable QKD network that can be used by a large number of users distributed over a wide area15. Quantum repeaters16,17 could in principle provide a viable option for such a global network, but they cannot be deployed using current technology18. Here we demonstrate an integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network that combines a large-scale fibre network of more than 700 fibre QKD links and two high-speed satellite-to-ground free-space QKD links. Using a trusted relay structure, the fibre network on the ground covers more than 2,000 kilometres, provides practical security against the imperfections of realistic devices, and maintains long-term reliability and stability. The satellite-to-ground QKD achieves an average secret-key rate of 47.8 kilobits per second for a typical satellite pass—more than 40 times higher than achieved previously. Moreover, its channel loss is comparable to that between a geostationary satellite and the ground, making the construction of more versatile and ultralong quantum links via geosynchronous satellites feasible. Finally, by integrating the fibre and free-space QKD links, the QKD network is extended to a remote node more than 2,600 kilometres away, enabling any user in the network to communicate with any other, up to a total distance of 4,600 kilometres.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.}
