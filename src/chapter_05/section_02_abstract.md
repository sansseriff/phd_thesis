## Aph 138b Homework Assignment

In March of 2022, Matthew Shaw was a guest lecturer for the Quantum Hardware and Techniques course (APh/Ph 138b). The following is a homework assignment I wrote to accompany his series of lectures. 

The first problem is inspired by the low dark count rate publication~[@Mueller:21]. It has the student build a simple model for a dark count rate transmitted through a series of filters. Finally, it leads the student to consider an ultimate tradeoff between dark count rate and coupling efficiency to wide bandwidth optical signals. A filtering system that only transmits a very narroband signal will not be able to detect ultra-short optical signals with high efficiency or temporal resolution. 

The second problem explores a potential use case of a photon number resolving SNSPD. It closely follows logic presented in an Andreas Christ and Christine Silberhorn paper~[@Andreas:12]. I studied this paper earlier in my PhD, when I considered developing a multiplexed single photon source. It turned out that project was overly ambitious, but future PhD students might consider approaching it again.
