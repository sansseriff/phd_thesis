## Abstract 


Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors are a type of time-correlated photon detector with low jitter performance especially in the mid-infrared. They are useful for classical communication over high loss channels --such as across deep space-- and for quantum communication for which signals are restricted to the few-photon level. For classical communication, high photon information efficiency communication may be achieved with Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) whereby data is encoded in the arrival time of an optical pulse with respect to a clock. In the process of demonstrating PPM on a 20\ Ghz clock, we study the effects of Photon Number Resolution (PNR) in new low-jitter types of SNSPDs. These PNR effects complicate fixed-threshold triggering of RF pulses from the SNSPD, and corrupt arrival time measurements if not properly managed. We demonstrate methods for simultaneous arrival time and photon number measurement which enables high clock rate PPM for space applications as well as high rate quantum communication and computing applications that benefit from photon number resolution. 


<!-- This first enables high clock rate PPM for space applications, but also highlights a path towards resource-efficient decoupling of photon number and arrival time information from low-jitter SNSPDs.  -->



<!-- Photon number resolution is an emerging feature of advanced Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors. If leveraged to it's full potential, PNR capability can have a profound impact on the usefulness of SNSPDs is certain quantum applications including linear optical quantum computing, quantum networks, and quantum sensing. Discrimination of not just the number of photons in an optical pulse but also pulse arrival time with high accuracy is an open problem, complicated by the nuanced way in which these two degrees of freedom are intertwined in the response function of these detectors. In this work we put a differential readout SNSPD to the ultimate test. We test it's capabilities in a Pulse Position Modulation experiment whereby data is sent in the arrival time of optical pulses derived from a 20\ GHz optical clock. We show the detector is capable of discriminating the arrival time of photons to 50\ ps wide bins with high accuracy while simultaneously providing photon number information about the impinging optical pulses. We find that a careful statistical analysis of the PNR response is necessary to back-out a precise measurement of pulse arrival time.  -->
