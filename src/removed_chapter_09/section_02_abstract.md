<!-- ## Aph 138b Homework Assignment -->

Note: the following section is primarily written by Samantha Davis, the second author of the paper [High-rate multiplexed entanglement source based on time-bin qubits for advanced quantum networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01804). **It is not a part of the main thesis** and does not appear in the thesis `.pdf`, as it is not primarily my work. However, it is included here for convenience and completeness.
