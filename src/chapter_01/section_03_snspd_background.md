## Introduction to SNSPDs

Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are high performance single photon detectors that operate at cryogenic temperatures. They stand out as the most capable single photon detection technology for near-infrared and increasingly mid-infrared wavelengths. They may be customized to exhibit extraordinary performance along a number of metrics including count rate, detection efficiency, dark count rate, and timing resolution. Some designs achieve excellent performance across all such metrics simultaneously, which makes them uniquely qualified for certain quantum communication and optics applications. This section elaborates on the fundamental principles underlying SNSPD operation, and reviews some recent SNSPD advancements and their relevance to certain applications. 

### Operation Principles

An SNSPD consists of a thin superconducting nanowire patterned on a substrate biased by a DC current. The nanowire is typically made of a superconducting material such as niobium nitride (NbN), niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN), or tungsten silicide (WSi). The nanowire is connected to a readout circuitry which is used to detect the electrical signals generated by the SNSPD upon absorption of a single photon.

When a photon hits the wire, it breaks a superconducting electron pair or Cooper pair. This disruption creates quasiparticles and initiates a downcoversion cascade.  This localized disruption of superconductivity in turn leads to the formation of region of reduced superconductivity called a hot-spot. The hot-spot has a higher resistance than the superconducting state, which due the initial flow of current induces a voltage pulse from this region. This pulse is shunted out of the nanowire and into a readout circuit, which amplifies the pulse and may include electronics for digitizing the pulse arrival time. Following the formation of the hotspot, the nanowire cools down through electron-phonon interaction with the substrate and returns back to the superconducting state, making it ready for the next photon detection.

The readout scheme typically adopted for the detection of these electrical signals involves separating the RF and DC components of the rf line from the SNSPD using a bias-T circuit. The RF component is then amplified using one or more cryogenic or room temperature amplifiers, followed by a free running or TCSPC based time tagger to digitize pulse arrival time. 


### Recent Advancements

Recent SNSPDs advancements revolve around improving the detection efficiency, count rate, timing jitter, sensitive wavelength range, and scalability to large arrays. Ultra-fast measurements of short superconducting wires have demonstrated timing jitters as low as 3~ps and illuminated the relationship between timing jitter and intrinsic detection latency effects [@Korzh2020]. System detection efficiencies from 98% to 99.5% have been demonstrated as well, and have highlighted the need to optimize the quality of the optical cavity surrounding the detector through ulta-high reflectivity mirrors or distributed bragg reflectors [@reddy2020superconducting; @99.5_Chang_2021]. More recently, single photon sensitivity has been demonstrated out to 29~Î¼m in thin silicon-rich WSi nanowires, paving the way for unique new SNSPD applications in astronomy and dark matter detection [@taylor2023lownoise]. Finally, with the development of a novel thermally coupled readout architechure, a 400,000 pixel SNSPD array has been demonstrated -- more than doubling the number of pixels from any previous superconducting detector array [@Oripov2023]. 

Going forward, there is a plethora of opportunities to improve the practicality of fabricating and using SNSPDs. There is a growing interest in wide superconducting strips with performance that rivals much narrower nanowire designs~[@Yabuno:23] thereby accommodating scalable photolithography processes. Finally, there is ongoing effort to raise critical current and critical temperatures in advanced SNSPD superconducting materials.
