## Structure of this thesis

This thesis is organized into four main chapters other than the introduction and conclusion. Each chapter is based on a major research project and includes an introduction, sections describing design choices and methods, and sections specifying results. Later sections in each chapter provide supplementary information and discussion. These are linked to from earlier sections in the chapter. 

The first appendix includes a homework assignment derived from Matthew Shaw's 2022 series of guest lectures in the course titled Quantum Hardware and Techniques (Caltech APh/Ph 138b). Both problems delve into concepts closely related to or motivating research in this thesis. The first problem examines some subtle and non-intuitive features of effective free space coupling for a single photon detector through a cryostat window. The second problem shows how high-efficiency coupling to a photon number resolving detector is extremely important for heralded generation of non-classical light.

The second appendix includes summaries and links to the major software repositories created for the research in this thesis. 

The third appendix includes a study of path imbalances in the type of Michelson interferometers used in the high rate entanglement source. This section is primarily written by the accompanying paper's second author, Samantha Davis.
