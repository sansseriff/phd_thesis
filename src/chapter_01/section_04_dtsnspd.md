## The differential readout and impedance matching taper design for SNSPDs

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer high efficiency, ultra-low dark count rates, high count rates, low timing jitter, and intrinsic photon-number resolution. However, traditional SNSPD designs face challenges in achieving both high detection efficiency and low jitter, especially for large-area detectors. Marco Colangelo et al. [@Colangelo2023] proposed a new device design for SNSPDs that combines differential readout and impedance matching tapers to overcome these challenges. They enable high detection efficiency and low jitter simultaneously along with pixel-level imaging capabilities and photon-number resolution.

Detectors of this design have been fabricated at JPL for the duration of my study, and are used primarily for three projects I managed: the low dark count rate project, the position modulation and photon number resolution project, and the high rate entanglement project. Given the significance of this device design to the presented corpus of research, we review it's key design features and performance characteristics in this section.

### Geometric jitter cancellation through differential readout

Two main types of jitter arise in high efficiency SNSPD designs; amplifier jitter and geometric jitter. Amplifier jitter is where the readout electrical noise impacts the timing jitter, while geometric jitter emerges from the propagation delays created by detection events at various parts of the meander. Nanowires made of thin-film materials exhibit high kinetic inductance and behave like transmission lines with high characteristic impedance and slow phase velocity. These transmission line properties result in pulse propagation delays and geometric effects that contribute to the timing jitter of the detector.  The arrival time of voltage pulses from the detector to time tagging equipment depends on the location of photon absorption in the nanowire, as detections closer to the ground termination and farther from the single readout must travel farther at low speed through the nanowire before exiting. For large detectors, geometric jitter can contribute tens of picoseconds to the total system jitter. As detector size is often correlated with coupling efficiency to a given optical mode, the use of single-ended readout implies a trade-off between system detection efficiency and jitter due to longitudinal geometric effects.

The implementation of a differential readout approach offers a solution to these issues. Instead of just isolating the positive voltage pulse , the negative pulse from the other end of the nanowire is also collected. Simple processing allows for the removal of any dependency on the location of the hot spot along the nanowire. This not only improves the timing jitter through compensation of the geometric contribution but also offers an insight into the photon absorption location.

If information on both photon arrival time $t_F$ and photon absorption location along the nanowire are of interest, then both the timing of the  $t_{neg}$ negative and positive $t_{pos}$ voltage pulses may be read out with 2 time tagger or high-speed oscilloscope channels. The difference of arrival time $t_{pos} - t_{neg}$ of these signals constitutes the photon absorption location information, while the average $1/2(t_{pos} - t_{neg})$ of the arrival times constitutes the photon arrival time information. For practical single photon counting applications, however, the photon arrival time information is typically sufficient and real-time processing of two time tags per detection event is not practical. Therefore, a 2:1 balun transformer can be used to perform an equivalent hardware difference of the complementary pulses (analogous to the averaging of timetags $t_{pos}, t_{neg}$). After amplification, the two sides of the detector are connected to the differential inputs of the balun, with the output being sent to a TCSPC or equivalent time tagging module. The threshold voltage of the time tagger can be set to minimize the spread of time tag distribution, corresponding to the condition where the timing measurement $t_{tagger} \approx t_F$ so that the photon arrival location information is cancelled out. 

# Increased SNR with impedance matching tapers

In a typical SNSPD the nanowire itself has impednace on the order of $\mathrm{k\Omega}$ while the readout circuit is $50\mathrm{\Omega}$. This impedance mismatch leads to RF pulses characterized by several reflections and distortions, which leads to a reduced slew rate and to a higher impact of the readout electrical noise on the timing jitter, referred to as amplifier jitter [@Korzh2020; @santavicca2019jitter].

One of the main challenges in SNSPD design is the trade-off between coupling efficiency and timing resolution for large-area detectors.

The issue of single-ended readout in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) arises from the impedance mismatch on both sides of the nanowire. With a single-ended readout configuration, the SNSPD is set up with a 50 ohm RF low-noise amplifier on one side, and the other side terminated to ground. The voltage pulses generated in these conditions are subject to distortions and reflections due to this impedance mismatch, which have implications for the resulting detection efficiency and timing jitter. Two main types of jitter arise; amplifier jitter and geometric jitter. Amplifier jitter is where the readout electrical noise impacts the timing jitter, while geometric jitter emerges from the propagation delays created by detection events at various parts of the meander. For large detectors, geometric jitter can contribute tens of picoseconds to the total system jitter. The single-ended readout typically needs a trade-off between system detection efficiency and jitter.

The implementation of a differential readout approach offers a solution to these issues. Instead of just isolating the positive voltage pulse, the negative pulse is also collected. Simple processing allows for the removal of any dependency on the location of the hot spot along the nanowire. This not only improves the timing jitter through compensation of the geometric contribution but also offers an insight into the photon absorption location. The power of this approach is demonstrated by the normalised sum of the time tags from both ends of the nanowire. It shows the jitter will not be influenced by the geometric contribution, removing the need for the trade-off required by the single-ended readout.

The issue of impedance mismatch can be mitigated through the implementation of an impedance matching taper. This component can be integrated to interface the nanowire impedance with the 50 ohms readout. The taper serves to transform the impedance and ultimately preserve the integrity of the output pulse. The advantage of this is that any reflections triggered by the impedance mismatch at the readout port are avoided. This results in an output pulse with a faster slew rate and higher amplitude, which in turn reduces the electrical noise contribution to the timing jitter through a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The resultant output impedance of a matching taper can increase the output amplitude by a factor of 3.3, as shown in the simulated results. Further complementing the reduction of longitudinal geometric jitter, the differential readout configuration provides a local feature that partially compensates for geometric jitter. This effectively provides a significant performance boost in timing resolution over conventional single-ended readout models.

In essence, the utilisation of a differential readout and impedance matching tapers successfully mitigate the impedance mismatch and geometric jitter problems. This concurrent use yields an increase in signal to noise ratio, along with a decrease in jitter through the compensation of the geometric contribution. These advances in SNSPD technology offer a trade-off between high detection efficiency and low jitter that was previously considered implausible.

Colangelo et al. illustrate these effects using a toy model and explain the need for impedance matching tapers to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce timing jitter. They also introduce the concept of differential readout to compensate for the geometric contribution to the timing jitter.

In the following section, the authors describe the readout design for the proposed differential SNSPDs. They explain that differential readout can be combined with high-resolution real-time oscilloscopes to achieve the best timing resolution. However, using two time taggers for each differential detector is impractical for practical applications. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose two readout schemes that make the differential detector compatible with a single-ended time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) module while still maintaining the advantages of differential compensation for geometric jitter. They explain the implementation details of these readout schemes and compare them to the traditional differential readout using a balun transformer.

In the subsequent section, the authors discuss the differential delay-line imaging capability of their proposed SNSPDs. They explain how the relative delay between the complementary pulses generated by the differential detector can be used to determine the spatial coordinate of photon absorption along the nanowire meander. They demonstrate the imaging capability using simulations and explain how the differential time histogram can be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of photon counts.

In the results and discussion section, the authors present the experimental characterization of their impedance-matched differential SNSPDs. They describe the device design, fabrication process, and performance metrics of the detectors. They show the signal waveform and timing performance of the differential SNSPDs using a laser source and high-speed oscilloscope. They also compare the time tagging procedures for the complementary pulses and demonstrate the equivalence between the differential time tag and the sum of the individual time tags.

In conclusion, the authors propose a new device design for SNSPDs that combines differential readout and impedance matching tapers to achieve high detection efficiency and low timing jitter simultaneously. They demonstrate the performance of their differential SNSPDs in terms of detection efficiency, timing jitter, delay-line imaging capability, and photon-number resolution. The authors also discuss the potential applications and impact of their detector technology in various fields of science.

Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive study on the differential SNSPDs with tapers and provides a thorough understanding of the device design, readout schemes, and performance characteristics. The proposed technology has the potential to advance the field of photon-counting detectors and enable new applications in quantum communication and other scientific fields.
