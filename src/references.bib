The DCR of the SSPD, which is dominated by the blackbody radiation at room temperature, is blocked by introducing cold optical bandpass filter. We employ the differential phase shift QKD (DPS-QKD) scheme with a 1\&\#xA0;GHz system clock rate. The quantum bit error rate (QBER) below 3\% is achieved when the length of the dispersion shifted fiber (DSF) is 336\&\#xA0;km (72\&\#xA0;dB loss), which is low enough to generate secure keys.},

@article{Calandri2016,
abstract = {Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 3 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m device. In a 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m x 20 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20{\%} reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m-long narrowed regions used for sensing photons.},

By introducing optical band-pass filters at the input of the SSPD and cooling the filters at 3 K, the dark count rate is reduced to less than 1/100 at low bias. An SSPD with 0.1 cps dark count rate and 5.6\% system detection efficiency at 1550 nm wavelength is obtained. We show that a quantum key distribution (QKD) over 300 km of fiber is possible based on a numerical calculation assuming a differential phase shift QKD protocol implemented with our SSPDs.}

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 \&\#x003BC;m in diameter, 70 \&\#x02013; 80\&\#x00025; efficiency at temperatures up to 4.2 K, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of \&\#x0223C; 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 \&\#x003BC;m diameter pixel. These performance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.},
