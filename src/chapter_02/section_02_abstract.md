## Abstract
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of transmitting high clock-rate pulse position modulated (PPM) data using a mode-locked laser and receiving it with a low jitter superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD). The investigation was driven by recent advancements in NbN SNSPDs, which have achieved a jitter as low as 50 ps at the FW(1/100)M level, enabling the demonstration of PPM with 50 ps slot widths and a 20 GHz clock. The aim was to increase the data rate by a factor of 10, from 2 GHz to 20 GHz, in the next generation of the Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) project.

During the course of this study, the focus shifted towards investigating the impact of photon number resolution (PNR) on the low jitter detection of optical pulses. PNR can have an unintended impact on the demonstration of high-rate PPM, and therefore a thorough study of its effects was deemed crucial. A novel PNR cancellation technique was developed and applied to successfully demonstrate high-rate PPM. This technique is considered essential for future low-jitter applications of SNSPDs that exhibit photon-number effects.
