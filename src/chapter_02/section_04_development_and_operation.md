In this work, a single mode fiber is imaged onto the detector using two f = 18.75  mm lenses. One lens collimates light from an optical fiber face outside the cryostat (Photon Spot), and the other focuses light onto the detector inside  [@Bellei:16]. In the collimated region between, the beam passes though a series of short-pass filters and one band-pass filter mounted at 4 K ( @fig:setup a). One of the short-pass filters is angled to avoid ghosting effects. The 40 K radiation shield and outer cryostat housing are fitted with anti-reflection coated BK7 windows. The filters are spring loaded to prevent cracking at low temperatures. To minimize effects of stray light, the interior of the 4 K shield was painted with mid-IR absorbing paint (Aeroglaze Z306)  [@Persky1999], while gaps between filters and the windows were covered with metal tape. 

The system is based on 1-inch optics, although the f = 18.75 mm lenses lead to a $1/e^2$ intensity diameter of about 5 mm in the collimated region. To reduce the larger-than-required numerical aperture of the system, painted 8 mm apertures (Acktar Spectral Black) were added in the collimated region. These are large enough to allow minor alignment adjustments --- by translating the exterior collimating lens --- without vignetting.

We use four custom cryogenic short-pass filters, with pass-bands below $1.6 \ \mathrm{\upmu m}$ and $1.9 \ \mathrm{\upmu m}$ (Andover Corp.), both with transmission at 1550 nm of 98.8 Â± 0.3\%. They reject wavelengths shorter than $3 \ \mathrm{\upmu m}$ through reflective optical coatings, and attenuate longer wavelengths through material absorption in the 12.7 mm-thick N-BK7 glass substrate. While the bandpass filter (FWHM = 7 nm) was found to blue-shift by about 2 nm at cryogenic temperatures, the passband was wide enough such that significant attenuation was not observed at the original target wavelength of 1550 nm. This filter is also sufficiently wide to avoid Fourier-limited broadening of ultra-short laser pulses.
