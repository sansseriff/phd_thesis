## Introduction


This is the introduction with some latex $\frac{33}{44}$

Something unique. 

![**Fidelity and rates across 8 channel pairs** a) Fidelity for the main 8 channel pairs, measured at a high (5.17 Amps) and a low ( 1.2 Amps) SHG pump power setting. Each power setting results in similar $\mu$ for all channels: $\mu_{low}$ = 5.6e-5 $\pm$ 9e-6 and $\mu_{high}$ = 6.1e-3 $\pm$ 3e-4.  b) Rate metrics for the 8 channel pairs at the same high and low power settings. The range of possible values for distillable entanglement rate is spanned by the yellow regions, bounded above by log-negativity and below by coherent information. Rates shown assume readout of all 4 available interferometer ports, based on data measured using one port each at Alice and Bob](./figs_03/8ch_bar_graph_high_power_light.svg){#fig:channel_data short-caption="Fidelity and rates across 8 channel pairs." width=100%}

this is where I add a citation
