### Slope Correction

![**PNR Slope Variation Analysis and Cancellation** a) 2D histogram of RF pulse measurements. Through graphing slope $\Delta t_{BA}$ on the x-axis and arrival time $t_A$ on the y-axis, a series of groupings are visible that identify the discrete photon numbers detected. ](./figs_03/slope_cancellation_light.svg){#fig:slope-correction short-caption="PNR Slope Variation Analysis and Cancellation" width=75%}
