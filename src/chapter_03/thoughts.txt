okay no branch stuff.


1. if you can't push to overleaf, that means its been updated. 
2. commit what you have in vscode
3. do a "git pull overleaf master"
4. You'll get a merge conflict in manuscript.tex, or in something else. 
5. put the manuscript.text on one side and the markdown on the other. Go through and modify the markdown. 




you could...

0. if overleaf has been updated..
0.5 commit what you have in master
1. create a new branch
2. pull the overleaf to the other branch
3. go back to master
4. pull the overleaf ALSO to master. 
5. This will give a merge conflict in manuscript.tex or something else
6. Go through and update the markdown by looking at manuscript.text
7. When finished, compile manuscript.tex again. 
8. Then, try merging the other branch and the main branch... There will now be differnt markdown files. I guess find a way to merge just the tex files?
9. This shows you where the differences are. If the differences are minor or non-significant, then you're good. You can just re-compile from mardkwon and delete the other branch if you want. 



so the compile process overwrote the bib file in the dist directory. If I do a git pull
