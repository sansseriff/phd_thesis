In composing this section of the thesis, I am faced with the daunting task of attempting to properly acknowledge the numerous individuals who have contributed to my intellectual and emotional development over the past six years. It is with a sense of deep humility and gratitude that I attempt to recognize these individuals, though I fear that I may inadvertently omit someone who has played a crucial role in my growth.

First and foremost, I must express my profound thanks to Boris Korzh, who has acted as a true mentor to me during my early years in academia. His unwavering commitment to knowledge and his insatiable desire to tackle the most challenging scientific problems have been an inspiration to me. I am also deeply grateful to Emma Wollman, who has been a constant source of support and guidance throughout my research. Her dedication and reliability have been crucial to my success.

I am also indebted to Eddy Ramirez, who was a consistent source of encouragement and humility in the early years of my PhD. His kindness and generosity were a constant reminder of the many blessings that I have been fortunate to receive. I must also thank Sahil Patel, who has been the best lab partner and friend anyone could ask for. Our conversations about life and research have provided me with much needed perspective and levity.

I am also grateful to Samantha Davis, who has been an invaluable source of knowledge and scientific rigor. Her expertise in quantum mechanics has been a constant source of inspiration to me. I am also thankful for Jamie Luskin, who has brought a much-needed element of candor and humor to our group. Her wit and intelligence have been a constant source of entertainment and enlightenment.

I must also express my deep gratitude to Neil Sinclair, who has been a dependable advisor and a source of great knowledge in the field of quantum optics. His friendship and expertise have been invaluable to me. I am also grateful to Cristian Peña, who introduced me to the world of teleportation and quantum optics. His dedication and expertise have been an inspiration to me.

I must also thank Ioana Craiciu, who has always been a bright presence in my life. Her passion for science and her keen intellect have provided me with much needed stimulation and inspiration. I am also grateful to Gregor Taylor, who has been an excellent climber and paper reviewer. His expertise and friendship have been invaluable to me.

Lastly, I must express my deep gratitude to Maria Spiropulu, who has been a daring and passionate mentor. Her ability to get things done has been an inspiration to me. I am also grateful to Matt Shaw, who has been an extremely friendly and supportive boss. His positivity and honesty have been crucial to my development.

In addition to these individuals, I must also acknowledge the contributions of Jason Trevor, Alex Walter, Andrew Beyer, and Hannah Rana. Their expertise and support have been crucial to my success.

As the physicist Richard Feynman once said, "The world is a wonderful place, and it is worth the trouble to understand it." I have been fortunate to have been a part of a community of individuals who share this passion for understanding the world, and I am grateful for the knowledge and insights I have gained through our collaborative efforts. -->





<!-- Of the many pages in this thesis, this small section is the most difficult to write. This difficulty does not come from thinking of who to acknowledge. Rather, it comes from the crushing fear of leaving someone out. The past six and a half years have been some of the most satisfying of my life, both from an intellectual and emotional standpoint. -->

<!-- Direction: Write a phd thesis acknowledgements section. Make it sound professional and eloquent. Don't be overly lavish in compliments. This should be about 900 words. 

!important: Group people together in paragraphs, don't always start each sentence with the name of the person. 

Direction: Start the section with a paragraph similar to this:
"""I've haven't had much respect for text; for saying certain things explicitly or in writing which seemed better off unsaid. Instead, I've valued most ephemeral and transient moments in between, permeated by shared feelings of respect, joy, and togetherness. It is challenging to project down my feelings I have toward these individuals who have collectively defined this period of my life. I may fail to capture the essence of shared connection, or the peculiarities of these many special relationships. 

Yet I can't deny the permanence of paper, or it's ability to fill in the gaps and let be known that which I which I didn't convey. In no particular order I'd like to acknowledge and thank the following people. """

Direction: Next, thank these people for the given reasons. The ratio out of 10 indicates how much attention to give each person. But specify that people are thanked in no particular order. Make large paragraphs for each of the gorups: mentors, friends & colleagues, main advisors, and others.
